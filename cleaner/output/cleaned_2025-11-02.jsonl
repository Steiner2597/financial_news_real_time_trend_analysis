Any insight is much appreciated. \"Wise\" is legally set up as a money transfer service, not a bank. Wise allows US Citizens to convert and hold foreign currencies. Wise has an opt-in feature to earn interest on GBP and EUR as a US citizen/resident. Likely due to complex US and international banking laws, a US customer earns interest in USD. Lets say I hold a balance of 100 GBP with Wise. Wise converts the 100 GBP to 130 USD and sweeps the money to their partner bank (JPMorgan Chase) in the USA. This money is covered by FDIC. The money earns interest on this USD. The interest is sent to Wise as USD and passed to me after they take a percentage as a fee. The interest is \"paid\" to me in USD but automatically converted back to GBP into my GBP balance. The interest is accrued daily and paid monthly. On any day at any time, I can convert my GBP to USD and send it to my US bank account. **My Wise account always shows a balance in GBP that does not fluctuate.** Wise is currently offering interest at 3.4% APY for USD, 2.42% APY for GBP, and 0.8% APY for EUR. This seems representative of the current prime rates of those currencies. https://wise.com/us/legal/us-interest-program-agreement \"*For EUR and GBP, their values will be converted to the USD equivalent before being swept and held in the same manner described above for USD. Conversions will be made once daily at the time the funds will be swept into the Deposit Account(s).*\" ---------------------------------------- Questions: Am I actually holding GBP or at least have the rights to GBP with this feature? How is Wise as a company protecting against currency fluctuations risk? Are they using currency futures contracts as a hedge, hence the fee they charge on those interest payments to me? Hypothetically, what happens if in one single day the USD devalues 1000x and now my 100 GBP is worth 130,000 USD? What happens to Wise, the partner bank, and my Wise account? What are those partner banks actually investing in? Do you think they are actually buying GBP bonds, hence the different APY rates?", "title": "Questions about Wise account foreign currency interest feature", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1olry0j/questions_about_wise_account_foreign_currency/", "author": "spilledonwhite", "score": 1, "subreddit": "investing", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T00:43:21.580235"}

But one of its rivals—the Amazon-backed developer Anthropic—has a clearer path to making a sustainable business out of AI. > >Anthropic and OpenAI do similar things: They develop advanced AI models upon which chatbots, image generators and a host of other AI tools are based. > >But they have approached the question of how to generate revenue—and, one would hope, profit—from AI in different ways. > >Outside of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, which integrates OpenAI’s models into Microsoft’s software products, OpenAI mostly caters to the mass market. Its user base is, in large part, replacing search-engine queries with bot conversations, which has proved immensely popular. ChatGPT had more than 800 million weekly users as of this month, according to the company, which has helped OpenAI reach an annual revenue run rate of around $13 billion, around 30% of which it says comes from businesses. > >Anthropic has generated much less mass-market appeal. The company has said about 80% of its revenue comes from corporate customers. Last month it said it had some 300,000 of them. > >That focus has helped put Anthropic ahead of OpenAI among business users. Its cutting-edge Claude language models have been praised for their aptitude in coding: A July report from Menlo Ventures—which has invested in Anthropic—estimated via a survey that Anthropic had a 42% market share for coding, compared with OpenAI’s 21%. Anthropic is also now ahead of OpenAI in market share for overarching corporate AI use, Menlo Ventures estimated, at 32% to OpenAI’s 25%. > >Anthropic is also surprisingly close to OpenAI when it comes to revenue. The company is already at a $7 billion annual run rate and expects to get to $9 billion by the end of the year—a big lead over its better-known rival in revenue per user. > >Both companies have backing in the form of investments from big tech companies—Microsoft for OpenAI, and a combination of Amazon and Google for Anthropic—that help provide AI computing infrastructure and expose their products to a broad set of customers. > >But Anthropic’s growth path is a lot easier to understand than OpenAI’s. Corporate customers are devising a plethora of money-saving uses for AI in areas like coding, drafting legal documents and expediting billing. Those uses are likely to expand in the future and draw more customers to Anthropic, especially as the return on investment for them becomes easier to measure. > >Demonstrating how much demand there is for Anthropic among corporate customers, Microsoft in September said Anthropic’s leading language model, Claude, would be offered within its Copilot suite of software despite Microsoft’s ties to OpenAI. > >The mass-market consumer revenue model is more nebulous. OpenAI has yet to settle on a way to make money from it beyond charging subscription fees. It has a $20-a-month “plus” plan and $200-a-month “pro” plan for consumers, in addition to a free tier that comes with limits on queries and runs more slowly. Such subscription fees aren’t enough to offset the massive cost of developing and rolling out cutting-edge AI. > >The obvious revenue stream for OpenAI’s consumer business will be advertising. But it isn’t clear how OpenAI or its competitors would inject ads into chatbots. It won’t be as straightforward as search ads; users wouldn’t likely welcome brand placement in their bot chats. And as it looks for an ad-revenue model, OpenAI is in the unenviable position of competing with Google, which has its own suite of mass-market AI tools and far deeper roots in advertising. > >Of course, OpenAI is making a strong appeal to business customers too, both through Microsoft and on its own. And there is an argument that OpenAI’s vast user base and exposure to a wider set of queries will give it an edge among corporate users. > >Yet there is also a possibility that OpenAI’s mass-market appeal becomes a turnoff for corporate customers who want AI to be more boring and useful than fun and edgy. OpenAI recently said it would begin allowing adults to have erotic conversations with ChatGPT, and has urged for a hands-off approach to AI regulation. Even if the company makes its products more constrained in corporate contexts, its freewheeling reputation seems likely to limit its inroads. > >For all of OpenAI’s spending, meanwhile, Anthropic has shown it is as good or better in AI arenas that companies care about. Vals AI, a startup that evaluates AI models, ranks the latest version of Anthropic’s large language model Claude as top in a business-focused benchmark that brings together finance, legal and coding tasks. > >“Anthropic is laser-focused on these agentic enterprise use cases and they’re playing a very competitive game with OpenAI right now,” said Rayan Krishnan, a co-founder of Vals. > >OpenAI and its chief-executive-slash-showman Sam Altman have been hogging the AI spotlight lately. Anthropic’s business prospects—and the shrewdness of its main investors, Amazon and Google—may be more deserving of notice. > >(News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a content-licensing partnership with OpenAI.)", "title": "[WSJ] OpenAI’s Less-Flashy Rival Might Have a Better Business Model", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1olsas9/wsj_openais_lessflashy_rival_might_have_a_better/", "author": "Prudent-Corgi3793", "score": 3, "subreddit": "StockMarket", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T00:43:20.458186"}

Almost 9% of the S&P 500 saw a 52-week low on Wednesday, sending an \"ominous signal\" as it's tough for bull markets to persist when stocks are falling in that way, according to Jonathan Krinsky, BTIG's chief market technician. \"Since 1990 there have only been four distinct periods\" when the S&P 500 had more 52-week lows than highs and the percentage of 52-week lows exceeded 8% while the index was within 3% of a 52-week high, Krinsky said in a note emailed Thursday. Those dates were December 1999, November 2007, July 2015 and November 2021, he said, noting that \"most market participants will recall those dates as essentially marking peaks before significant drawdowns.\" \"While we don't know if this period will follow suit, we do think the market is entirely too complacent about downside risk,\" Krinsky said.

It is not only defined by the GDP growth during the time, but also the sectors that performs well during those times. |Cycle|GDP Growth|Sectors|Rates| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Recession|\\-2% to 0%|Defensives|Lowest| |Early Recovery|0%-2%|Early Cyclicals|Low| |Mid-cycle|2%-4%|Technology/Resources|Rising| |Late Recovery|0.5%-2%|Technology/Industrials|Falling| |End of Cycle|0%-0.5%|Healthcare/Staples/Utilities|Falling| So if we operate according to the framework, let's check. * GDP Growth: 3.8% for Q2 2025, if we exclude datacenters and AI, it's at 0.1%. * Sectors: Tech stocks going new highs but so are the likes of Caterpilla and DOW Chemicals * Rates: More coming rate cuts expected The thesis that we are at the precipse of transitioning into End of Cycle is confirmed by the rates and the sector that's currently outperforming. GDP growth is a more intricate one since we are in a K-shaped society where while consumer discretionary is dropping among most incomes, the upper incomes and tech chads are propping up the economy for now. The likes of Costco, Walmart, Pepsi, Unitedhealth, Pfizer and many more have taken a beating in recent months, but have started to recover to prior to April 2025.

The feedback from my last post was great and i did not expect that much interest. The sheet was shared over 700 times??? Anyways, thanks for the nice comments, questions and messages. So, for the updates i have made: - I added a gradient on the bar chart to more clearly show what is good/bad valuations. - I added historical FY revenues from 2022-2024 + Wall street estimates for 25 and 26. This makes it easier to see how the revenue scale into income. - Estimated revenue growth rate from 2024-2026. This is nice as the CAGR of the EPS can vary based on small number in divisor or one-off charges etc. Now, the biggest update is in my weighted PEG ratio which i use to sort the rows (the column furthest to the right). I added a 2030 PEG ratio column that i use to weigh the PEG towards future growth. I also readjusted the weights as follows: - 2025: 0.2 -> 0.1 - 2026: 0.3 ->0.4 - 2027: 0.5 -> 0.3 - 2030: (new) -> 0.2 I want to be cautious with weighing the model too much towards growth, as it creates more risk. The main goal is tho have a sheet that quickly sorts stocks based on recent price movements, to give a indication of what company to look into. My goal is to beat the SP500 and Nasdaq, so if you have any suggestions on stocks that can be added to the sheet, please leave a comment or send me a DM :) If you have tips on improvement to the sheet that is also more than welcome!

My Goal & Horizon: A 70/30 stocks and bonds portfolio. My primary goal is heavy growth exposure now, with a conservative sleeve to capitalize on future dips.

TIPS Allocation: Is 10% in TIPS sufficient for inflation protection, or would you recommend shifting some of the BIV allocation to TIPS, or even removing TIPS?

The deals include Samsung building an AI factory with 50,000 Nvidia GPUs to automate chip manufacturing, with Samsung also in talks to supply next-generation HBM4 memory chips to Nvidia. Hyundai will deploy Blackwell GPUs for AI-driven mobility solutions as part of a $3 billion AI cluster initiative. CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at the APEC CEO Summit in Seoul, expressed optimism over eventually selling Blackwell chips to China while acknowledging the decision rests with President Trump. Huang characterized China as an irreplaceable market representing a $50 billion opportunity this year and potentially hundreds of billions by decade’s end, though he noted the company is hoping for non-zero market share while expecting zero. He downplayed national security concerns, stating China produces plenty of AI chips domestically and has blocked Nvidia’s H20 chips, suggesting China doesn’t want U.S. chips for security reasons. The South Korea deal came as Nvidia crossed the $5 trillion market valuation threshold, becoming the first company to reach that milestone. Goldman Sachs raised its price target to $240, maintaining a buy rating and expecting another beat-and-raise quarter. Huang acknowledged the company faces challenges in high-bandwidth memory supply but expressed confidence both Korean suppliers will succeed with HBM4 production. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives characterized the South Korean partnerships as a watershed moment for Nvidia’s international AI infrastructure buildout.

{"id": "1olc4gl", "created_at": "2025-11-01T01:44:00Z", "text": "How the tokenization is related to pies? **“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”**: – Aristotle. When one is in their youth, the issue of searching for a companion is often at the top of one’s mind. The libido can take precedence over anything else, especially if there is a certain chemistry that clicks with another person. It is in this spirit that marriages can be the natural progression of this kind of relationship. In combination, both people find more happiness together than they would apart. Naturally, the next step would be to procreate and add a family member to this happy union. We can see that Aristotle did not necessarily refer to personal relationships when he issued his comment about the whole being greater than the parts. How does this apply to investing? First, companies often seek out other enterprises to become larger, more efficient, more profitable, or improved entities by virtue of adding product lines, intellectual capital, additional assets, or some combination thereof. Second, one tactic of investment is to identify companies where there is a large quantity of assets or operating businesses that the investment community is not recognizing for their total worth. The term given to this style is the sum of the parts investing. Now, let’s consider what is taking place in the world, which has many investors agog over the possibilities. It is the tokenization of every asset that can be sliced and diced. What exactly is tokenization? Tokenization is the process of converting the ownership rights of any asset into a digital token on a blockchain. The concept of “tokenization of everything” is accelerating as institutions and investors digitize a vast array of assets, from real estate to stocks. The underlying principle involves using smart contracts on a blockchain to create and manage these digital representations. Each token contains the rules and rights of ownership for the asset it represents. The range of assets that can be tokenized is comprehensive, encompassing financial assets, real estate, intangible assets (intellectual property- including patents, music royalties, carbon credits, and renewable energy), collectibles, and currencies. Proponents argue that the benefits of tokenization are improved liquidity with fractional ownership, which can be subdivided as small as one can imagine, and improved transparency with every record on the blockchain. All payments, like dividends, are automated for faster settlement and lower minimum investments, providing much wider access to previously restricted assets. The move to digitize everything allows banks, brokers, and custodians to offer every kind of transaction possibility in one place. You are seeing it happen at Fidelity, Schwab, Chase, BlackRock, Blackstone, and many others, giving access to digital assets like crypto-related tokens and stablecoins, along with stocks, bonds, cash, indexes, CDs, and in retirement accounts. From my perspective, a key issue is reducing costs and settlement times for those responsible for custody. From an investment point of view, just because an asset is tokenized and made more accessible does not make it more valuable. More people may be able to buy it at smaller dollar amounts, but the mere fact that it can be purchased more easily does not make the underlying economic value increase over time. In many cases, more assets are issued each year, which makes the threshold for acceptable levels of growth higher. If you split a pie into more pieces, it does not make the pie taste better or allow the owner to sell more pies. It makes it easier to buy one piece, but if the pie is not delicious and does not look good, people are not going to buy it.

{"id": "1olb4vk", "created_at": "2025-11-01T00:52:47Z", "text": "Eastman Chemical Company, An Attractive Buy? If you have any questions feel free to message me or comment here. Thesis Eastman Chemical Company ($EMN) is mispriced by the market trading at 8.8x forward p/e, a valuation closer to cyclical peers such as AdvanSix ($ASIX), rather than specialty chemical companies such as DuPont ($DD) which trades at 17.74x forward p/e. This clear valuation gap suggest that investors still view Eastman close to its cyclical chemical producers, that is still exposed to swings in demand – Despite steady margins and a strategic pivot towards high margin specialty materials. I’m bullish on Eastman because the market is overlooking that their resilient margins, insider confidence and changing business mix, position it well for changes in investor sentiment. As investors start to recognise the companies more stable earnings and cash flow, amid its earnings on November the 3rd. 1. Margin resilience, Eastman has held steady its margins through a weak macro cycle (down only 0.9% YoY to 15.6%), showing a clear difference from its cyclical peer. 2. Structural shift, Eastman has reduced exposer to volatile segments. Such as, Chemical Intermediates (CI), which is now less than 25% of its product mix, historically 40%. Reflecting steady shift towards steady earnings and less cyclical changes. 3. Sentiment changes, recent insider buying, of over $1.9million, cost cutting initiatives and high capital expenditure focused on sustainable products create a realistic path for investors to view Eastman as more like a speciality chemicals company. Bringing them more in line with specialty multiples. A change in investor perception to coincide with fundamentals could see forward p/e around the 14x-15x ratio. This could lead to a 30% – 40% upside for the stock, from current levels. Plus, benefits of current high dividend yield of 5.3% make EMN an attractive buy. Company Overview Founded in 1920 and headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee USA, Eastman Chemical Company ($EMN), formerly a subsidiary of Kodak until 1994, is one of the world’s leading chemical product manufactures. It is globally diversified with 35 manufacturing facilities in 16 different counties and 60% of its total revenue being generated outside the US. Out of the over 1000 products they can be grouped into four different primary segments. 1. Advanced Materials – high performance polymers used in electronics, packaging and other applications. This is now Eastmans largest segments, with $777m in revenue last quarter. 2. Additives & Functional Products (AFP) – Performance additives for other chemicals. Used for coating, lubricants and plastics. 3. Fibers – Sustainable materials made from recycled waste and wood. Applications are in fashion, home textiles and linings. 4. Chemical Intermediates (CI) – Commodity and basic chemicals sold to other manufacturers and used in other products Eastman’s sell. Compared to peers like AdvanSix (ASIX) and DuPont (DD), Eastman benefits from greater product diversification and scale from its vertical integration. With 60% of its revenue being generated outside the US and 35 global manufacturing sites this mitigates any single market risks. Furthermore, Eastman’s size, from vertically integrated production, gives it cost advantages over its peers, as they are less reliant on external suppliers, helping them control input costs. This gives it considerable competitive advantages of its competitors in the chemical intermediates segment, where products are homogenous and competition is based upon primarily price factors. News / Catalysts Q3 earnings on November 3rd could act and a key catalyst to change investor sentiment. If again Eastman was to post about its steady margins amid global weakness, it would further differentiate it from its peers in the cyclical chemical manufacturers. Its earnings would be more akin to that of a speciality chemicals company; this could lead to a revaluation rating and triggering significant change to the upside in the share price. The CEO and Chairmen, Mark J Costa, along with ten other insiders, in late September bought up over $1.9 million worth of stock at an average price of $68.90, this gives me great confident this is a buy ahead of the recent upcoming earnings on the 3rd. Historically, insider buying at Eastmans has been a reliable signal for growth, in both 2009 and late 2015, similarly both times saw an over 15% gain in the following months. Together, insider buying suggests management’s belief that there is mispricing’s in Eastman’s earnings, reinforcing my thesis that sentiment could shift post Q3. Over the long term, European crackdown on unsustainable materials / regulations benefiting sustainable packaging create a great opportunity for Eastman to continue to capitalise from. As Eastman holds the technology required to create speciality recycled materials such as methanolysis compared to its peers like AdvanSix. Furthermore, sentiment shifts towards more sustainable packaging solutions create significant tailwinds for Eastmans sustainable high margin polymers in its ‘advanced materials and AFP segments, where demand is rising. Combined, these mid – long term factors such as, earnings stability, insider buying and sustainability tailwinds can lead to short term changes in investor sentiment and consequently significant upward movements in share price. Valuation / Data Eastman trades at a forward p/e of 8.8x and EV/EBITDA of 6.47x roughly half the multiples of specialty peer DuPont (DD), which trades at 17.74x and 12.52x respectively. Despite this discount, Eastman maintains not to dissimilar profitability, with 13.87% operating margins versus DuPont’s 16.6%, and much stronger shareholder returns, ROE: 14.52% compared to DuPont’s 0.31% This valuation gap suggests that the market still views Eastman like a cyclical commodity producing company. Similar to AdvanSix Inc (ASIX) which trades at an EV/EBITDA of 5.28 x and ROE of 9.85%. Rather than recognising its structural shift towards high margin specialty products. This misalignment with fundamentals shows clearly in the share price making them relatively cheap comparted to competitors. Investors are yet to price in Eastman’s transition towards less volatile less cyclical materials and its growing exposure to more stable products. If Eastman’s were to be re-rated closer to its speciality peers, this would see the share price increase by roughly 30% from current levels. Eastman’s valuation and perception as cyclical chemicals company largely stems from its historical exposure to cyclical markets such as commodities. Despite clear operational progression away from such markets their forward p/e is yet to reflect this change. Moreover, Eastman’s free cash flow in 2024 was up 26% YoY, and management expects further growth as it reduces capital expenditure from $700 million to $500 million by 2026, saying there “positioned to quickly resume investment when economic recovery occurs”. Moreover, achieved cost savings of around $75million in 2025 and targeted cost savings of $75-$100 million in 2026. These put Eastman is a considerable favourable position to improve shareholder returns with its sustain dividend of 5.6% and through share buybacks. Risks Key risks include continued weaknesses in global demand, particularly from automotive and construction markets, which could delay margin expansion. Additionally, while capital expenditure reductions improve free cash flow, underinvestment or mismanagement of funds may hinder sustainability projects and slow transition towards them. Tariffs and economic uncertainty may continue to delay product launches for Eastman’s consumers. Finally, if management fails to effectively communicate progress, investor sentiment may remain tied to its cyclical past, limiting any revaluations effecting share price. Conclusion Overall, I believe that Eastmans Chemical Co is a rating of ‘BUY’ as it offers investors a compelling value investment. Despite progression towards becoming a speciality chemicals company, the stock still trades at multiples akin to cyclical valuations. This creates a gap for long / mid term investors to take advantage of. With resilient margins, insider confidence, cost savings and, a 5.3% dividend yield; Eastman’s presents stability and upside potential. Thank you for reading my analysis.

{"id": "1okv2u9", "created_at": "2025-10-31T13:47:38Z", "text": "While KT screens as a value play, the lack of a moat kept me from investing KT looks cheap: 5x forward earnings, 4% dividend, EV/EBITDA 4x,but I’m passing. In a 3-player market that should mint steady returns, Korea’s telcos keep earning ROIC below WACC and spraying cash into side quests (AI, fintech, media, real estate). My base-case value is $19.3 per ADR (basically fair) so the risk/reward isn’t there. **What looked attractive** * Structure: Three national operators (SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus). High barriers to entry, spectrum moat, massive capex already sunk. * Price: KT trades at bargain multiples and pays a solid dividend. * Hidden assets: Meaningful real-estate portfolio and a cloud/data-center business; potential for “value-up” monetization. * Recent optics: Margins improved off 2024’s one-offs; buybacks and a more explicit shareholder-return posture. On paper this is the kind of steady compounder you want in the income sleeve. **Why I cooled off** 1) No durable edge. KT doesn’t beat peers on network, brand, or pricing power. In a rational oligopoly you’d expect fat margins; in Korea, the players still compete hard. The result is decent service for consumers and mediocre economics for shareholders. 2) ROIC tells the truth. Over a decade, KT’s ROIC has sat below its cost of capital. Same story for the leader, SKM, albeit slightly better. That means growth has destroyed value at the margin. 3) Capital allocation drift. Instead of doubling down on the core (where scale should matter), KT chased adjacency after adjacency from AI platforms, content studios, payments to real-estate projects. 4) Governance and politics. CEO churn, state-linked influence, and recurring investigations are not the ingredients of a focused, long-term plan. Even good operators struggle when the goalposts move. 5) Saturation + aging. Mobile subs exceed the population; broadband is near universal. Upsell gets harder as demographics tilt older and price sensitivity rises. 5G/6G add cost faster than revenue. **Valuation (details here https://www.beatingthetide.com/i/176947346/valuation-dcf-and-sum-of-the-parts)** * DCF base case: I anchor group EBITDA margin in the high-teens, capex \\~12% of revenue, modest top-line growth, and conservative working capital. That lands at \\~$19.3/ADR...basically where it trades. * SOTP cross-check: * Core ICT at 5.5x EV/EBITDA * Finance (BC Card / K-Bank exposure) at a haircut multiple * Real estate marked well below blue-sky talk * Cloud/Content at a discounted private-market comp * Less net debt/minorities → $24/ADR in a cleaner, value-unlock scenario. That’s upside, but not “must-own” upside given execution and political risk. **What would change my mind** * ROIC > WACC with proof it’s durable. Two or three clean years would get attention. * Refocus the portfolio. Spin, sell, or ring-fence non-core assets; recycle proceeds to buybacks or the highest-return pieces of the network. * Policy stability. Less meddling in pricing and management seats, more predictability on spectrum and subsidies. * AI numbers: Real revenue, real margins, real customers at scale. **Why I’m not short either** KT is not broken. Cash flows are real. The balance sheet isn’t reckless. You’ll likely get your dividend while the stock grinds sideways. I just don’t see a credible path to outsized returns versus better opportunities elsewhere. **My stance** Neutral/Hold. 1–3 year horizon, fair value $19.3 per ADR. KT is a value trap dressed like a bargain: cheap for reasons that haven’t gone away, sub-WACC returns, diffuse strategy, political overhang, and a saturated market. Could it work tactically? Sure. Is it one of the best risk-adjusted setups I can own today? Not for me. Happy to share my model assumptions if you want to stress-test the margins or multiples.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I have several individual stocks, held at the various transfer agents (ComputerShare, Broadridge, EQ) that were acquired as gifts over time when I was a child in the 90s/early 2000s. Gaining control of them all (getting dividend checks sent to my address rather than theirs, for example) has been a sllloooowww painful process, which I found out just today, I has STILL not been fully completed; as my mother just called to tell me she had a dividend check for me at her house. \\*sigh\\* I'm still trying to get a handle on everything, and get it all streamlined. My parents are old-school, and still drive their happy tushes to the bank to deposit those paper dividend checks LOL! I can't handle all that! I've sucessfully set up online accounts with computershare and broadridge. EQ says I've set up an account, but I beg to differ (but that's not the point, unless someone knows a trick to this issue). My real question is: there's a significant amount of asset \"moving\" I would like to accomplish, but I'm not sure how to go about all of it; and what's the best way is to accomplish my goals while minimizing fees. CURRENT GOALS: 1. CERTIFICATE SHARES: Those initial gift transfers were actual certificates. Some were set up with DRIP, some were not. Either way, wether through DRIP or splits, etc, the majority of my holdings are a combination of certificate shares and plan/book holdings. I would like to send them all in and get them converted to electronic shares. But neither transfer agent seems to have a form for this on their site. So what do I need to do for that? 2. Transfer to my children's trust: I would like to transfer a small portion of each/ most of my holdings to my children's trust. I HAVE located forms for this, and will get them signed/ medallion stamped tomorrow. The trust does have it's own EIN. Is there a limit, for tax purposes for either the trust or myself, that I should take into consideration when determining how much/ what/ when I do these transfers? 3. Transferring to Interactive Brokers: I'm intending to utilize their SBLOC/ Margin Loan feature to help get my children and myself through a seemingly never-ending, financially draining custody/ child support battle; and since one of my children is very young I'm not working very much at the moment. I certainly don't need a massive capital gains hit, (not to mention the loss of the assets long term), while my normally taxed earned income is also lower than normal. I know they require portfolio diversity, and the maximum amount they'll loan is 1/2 of your portfolio. And I know there's going to be a transfer fee for each holding. But I also need to have some liquid cash in the next 2 weeks hopefully, so I'm trying to get this going as quickly as possible. \\- Would it be best to get all shares converted to electronic shares BEFORE transfering an individual asset to IBKR? Or should I go ahead and transfer the book/ plan holdings that I currently have, as the certificate to electronic conversion will take more time than I can afford to wait?", "title": "Managing Certificate Shares and Transfers", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oko94l/managing_certificate_shares_and_transfers/", "author": "MomWhoNeedsALifeX2", "score": 3, "subreddit": "investing", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T00:23:28.761999"}

I took a closer look at China's medium-term economic goals, especially the 14th Five-Year Plan. In doing so, I discovered three areas where the state is pouring in a lot of money and which are supposed to grow significantly by 2030. Now I am looking for tips for specific companies (stocks) or ETFs that could benefit most from these state strategies. My Top 3 Areas and Investment Ideas: 1. AI & Semiconductors: The government is pursuing an aggressive autonomy strategy. Huge sums are flowing into important areas of semiconductor production and AI infrastructure (especially domestic GPU hardware) so that the country can become more independent. Questions for the community: Which Chinese stocks (semiconductor equipment, materials, local GPU manufacturers) do you think benefit most from this state capital and the autonomy drive? Which companies besides SMIC are also important in building these supply chains domestically? Are there specific ETFs that better reflect this domestic focus than broad technology funds? 1. Green Energy & Clean Technologies: China is investing heavily in the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2060. The focus is on the digitalization of the power grids and energy storage, especially batteries (investments here increased by 69% in the first half of 2025). Questions for the community: Which stocks in the area of smart grids/VPP (Virtual Power Plants) or battery component manufacturing, besides the big players (like CATL), benefit most from the restructuring of the national energy system? Are there recommended Clean Tech China ETFs that place a strong emphasis on domestic storage and grid integration and not just on solar cell production? 1. Biotechnology & Bioeconomy: This sector is considered a strategic future industry, with a clear focus on biopharmaceuticals and national biosecurity. The government absolutely wants to bring biotech and IT together. Questions for the community: Which specific companies (biopharma, CDMOs or advanced seed technology) are considered leading innovators in China and benefit directly from this state funding for the bioeconomy? Important Risk Assessment My analysis shows that state-led industrialization carries risks that must be kept in mind: Overcapacity: High state funding can lead to overcapacity and strong price drops (similar to steel, solar, and electric cars in the past). Geopolitics: Technology (AI, biotech) and the strategy of military-civil fusion increase the risk of sanctions and export controls. Question on risk management: Which companies/ETFs do you think are best equipped against these risks (especially overcapacity and geopolitical pressure)? How do you take these factors into account when determining your position sizes? I look forward to every helpful contribution and concrete suggestion!", "title": "Looking for China Stock/ETF Ideas: Focusing on 14th FYP 'Autonomy' Goals (IC/AI, Green Tech, Biotech)", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1olo0ke/looking_for_china_stocketf_ideas_focusing_on_14th/", "author": "NumberOne_Lacruz", "score": 0, "subreddit": "stocks", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T00:23:28.431982"}

The core conviction is that market efficiency problems are creating non-directional alpha. 1) The Liquidity Dominance: Research confirms that liquidity risk dominates credit risk in explaining variations in yield spreads for emerging corporate and sovereign debt. Liquidity alone explains as much as 25% of the cross-sectional variation in corporate bond yield spreads. 2) The Duration Sweet Spot: The 2 to 5 year corporate bond segment is emerging as the optimal duration strategy, offering an ideal combination of attractive yields, limited interest rate sensitivity, and superior liquidity characteristics in the current environment. 3) The Crowding Risk: Corporate bond issuance has shifted from loans, reaching ₹51.58 trillion (18% of GDP) in the Indian market alone. This trend, supported by competitive spreads, could rapidly create a liquidity gap if institutional demand shifts suddenly. The market is mispricing liquidity risk.

I know many hate PEs because they don’t tell the full story, which is true, but they can be one of many tools to assess the market. Having said that, I’m always trying to play devils advocate, even with my own thesis. I’m trying to come up with scenarios that could normalize valuations without a crash, even ones that may seem improbable. I feel like it would be tough to generate enough revenue from AI to grow into their valuations. But what does seem feasible is the possibility of MAG7 cutting AI spending at some point. I know that seems highly improbable at the moment, but I feel like the unexpected is often what happens. If MAG7 cut AI spending (or reached economies of scale to reduce spending), it seems highly likely that their existing revenue streams, which are very strong, would remain intact.

I've been trying to wrap my head around the fundamentals of stock growth and the opportunities and dangers and I wonder if someone with knowledge can tell me if there's any merit to any of this: On a basic level, if more people are willing to buy than sell a stock, then the price will go up. But also, there must be a finite amount of liquidty with which to purchase stocks and once that liquidity is depleted through buying stock, then stock prices rises must slow down and level off. Take the term \"depleted\" broadly just for the sake of this exercise. However that also got me thinking, what if financial investment instiutions then just borrow more money with which to purchase stocks. They see the prices rising and say, \"We need more money to ride this gravy train!\" So they borrow more to purchase stocks and so demand continues to go up and stocks continue to rise. But if this is the case, isn't there an inherent danger in that if at any point there's a price dip that starts to spook those investors that borrowed, then they'll want to get out fast so they can keep their gains and pay off the borrowed debt? The last thing they want is to owe someone money and find themselves paying interest and unable to pay it off without realising a loss. So these fears feed in to the stock price causing it to drop further, which in turn then hits another tier of investors who also borrowed and now find their investment reaching negative equity so they too cash out and then we find ourselves in a sudden downard spiral in a race to get out fast. Is any of this a thing? Do large investment institutions borrow to make these kind of investments or do they only buy with what they have on the books from their clients? Because I feel like either the stock market must stop climbing at some point due to liquidty running out OR if there's a lot of borrowing going on then at some point that's got to cause a crash the moment the market gets spooked and now everyone is racing to pay off their debts while they can. I'm sure it's all a lot more complicated than this but I'm just curious if the stock growth built on debt is a thing or just some other magic juice where growth spurts out of thin air, unrelated to actual liquidity.

Hi everyone Seagate Technology Holdings plc, founded in 1978, is a pioneering force in data storage, inventing the first 5.25-inch hard disk drive. Headquartered in Singapore with operations in Fremont, California, the company specializes in mass-capacity hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and hybrid solutions. With over 35,000 employees and a history of shipping 4+ zettabytes of data, Seagate serves cloud providers, enterprises, consumers, and sectors like healthcare, media, and autonomous vehicles. FY2025 (ended June 2025), Seagate reported record revenue of $9.1 billion, up significantly from $6.55 billion in FY2024, driven by AI-fueled demand for high-capacity storage. Q1 FY2026 (ended Oct. 2025) saw $2.63 billion in salesa 21% YoY surge and non-GAAP EPS of $2.61, exceeding estimates, with shares jumping 19% post-earnings. Gross margins hit 36.2%, bolstered by cost discipline and a $5 billion share repurchase program. Analysts forecast 2025 revenue at $9.55–$9.85 billion and EPS of $8.60–$9.06, with market cap at \\~$47 billion.Seagate dominates the HDD sector, holding \\~40–41% unit market share in 2025, in a duopoly with Western Digital (42%) and Toshiba (17–19%). The global HDD market, valued at $44–48 billion, grows at 6.5% CAGR amid exabyte-scale AI needs, where HDDs excel in cost-effective, dense archival storage over SSDs.Innovation defines Seagate's edge: Its Mozaic platform leverages Heat-Assisted Magnetic Recording (HAMR) for 30TB+ drives, shipping over 1 million units by Q4 2025 and targeting 5TB/platter by 2028 at lower $/TB. Exos CORVAULT offers 24/7 enterprise reliability. Recent moves include acquiring Intevac for $119 million to accelerate HAMR. Cloud hyperscalers (87% of revenue) drive growth, with FY2028 targets of 10–15% CAGR and 40% margins.Challenges include SSD competition, macroeconomic risks, and currency fluctuations, but AI's $23 billion storage opportunity by 2028 positions Seagate for sustained leadership.

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.

Google just announced a major breakthrough in quantum computing. Their new algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” ran on their Willow 105‑qubit chip and reportedly achieved a 13,000× speed‑up over the best classical supercomputer for a targeted computation. That is a huge shift if it holds up. What really catches my eye is how this could reshape AI compute infrastructure. Today most of the AI narrative is about GPUs, data centers and training massive models. Nvidia dominates in that world. But if quantum hardware becomes practical at scale, the entire compute stack – from chips to cloud to software – could pivot. Google already links Quantum Echoes to real‑world applications like molecular modeling and materials science, even drug discovery. In contrast, Nvidia’s story is brilliant and likely still valid in the near term, but it might be structured around the current paradigm of GPU‑first compute. If the paradigm shifts, Nvidia might face more competition or structural limit. Meanwhile, Google is quietly moving on the underlying compute frontier. Their blog says this demonstration is a step toward “real‑world applications of quantum computing” and not just academic fireworks. From an investment perspective this means one of two things: either Google’s quantum efforts take years to pay off (in which case Nvidia remains the safer bet) or we’re at the beginning of a compute inflection and Google is underpriced for the long term. Given how many institutions are locked into GPU chains already, the transition won’t be overnight, but the potential upside looks significant.", "title": "Why I care more about Google than NVDA", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okiujw/why_i_care_more_about_google_than_nvda/", "author": "BernKurman", "score": 0, "subreddit": "stocks", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T00:23:28.210810"}

{"id": "1ok3kzx", "created_at": "2025-10-30T15:58:53Z", "text": "GENDA (TSE:9166): Japanese arcade roll-up organically doubling sales in the US TL;DR Japanese roll-up GENDA (TSE: 9166) trades around 7.5× FY2026 EV/EBITDA despite consistently acquiring cash-generative assets at 3–6× EBITDA and achieving strong organic growth: especially in the U.S., where rebranded locations have more than doubled same-store sales. The company now prioritizes funding growth through operations, but M&A remains central to its model. With debt costs near 1%, GENDA’s structure is unusually efficient compared to Western peers. GENDA is a Japanese entertainment roll-up, consolidating a fragmented industry of arcades, karaoke venues, and prize game operators. Its business model is straightforward but powerful: acquire existing venues at low EBITDA multiples, rebrand and optimize operations, and monetize Japan’s strong entertainment IP (anime, gaming characters, and merchandise) through these physical spaces. CEOs of said businesses are often well over retirement age without a successor, whilst very large inheritance taxes loom when they don't sell their business before passing. GENDA has become the \"buyer of choice\" for many of these businesses. Since 2018, GENDA has completed more than 50 acquisitions, often at low-mid single digit EBITDA multiples, compared to its own public valuation range that historically peaked above 25× EV/EBITDA during periods of optimism. Even after a significant derating, the company currently trades around 7.5× next year’s EBITDA, leaving meaningful headroom for accretive M&A. The group’s core operations center on GiGO, the well-known Japanese arcade brand it acquired from Sega, alongside several karaoke chains and smaller amusement operators. In Japan, management sees steady but limited organic growth (ranging from 3-8%) yet the domestic market remains an excellent hunting ground for discounted acquisitions. Low rates, stable foot traffic (boosted by inbound tourism), and fragmented ownership make Japan a structurally favorable M&A environment. Internationally, GENDA is investing in expansion through NEN, Player One Entertainment, and a partnership with Walmart, giving it more than 13,000 mini-arcade sites in North America. These are compact, unmanned crane-game installations in malls and retail spaces, designed for high turnover and low operating costs. When GENDA replaced existing machines with its own Japanese hardware and prize concepts, sales more than doubled in all operating locations. This growth underscores the company’s thesis that Japanese-style physical entertainment, supported by strong intellectual property, can succeed abroad with proper localization. GENDA makes a distinct difference between domestic, where dirt-cheap acquisitions make up most of the growth, and international, where there's plenty of room both through M&A as well as organic investments. The broader strategic direction has evolved. Management has emphasized that the priority now is self-financed growth and debt discipline, aiming to avoid negative free cash flow after several years of expansion funded primarily through debt and equity issuance. However, this does not represent an abandonment of M&A. GENDA’s leadership has explicitly stated that inorganic growth will remain a core driver, and that higher EBITDA from each acquisition expands their debt capacity. This in turn effectively allows further M&A funded through balance sheet strength. This discipline coincides with a still-favorable financing environment. The company’s average borrowing cost remains near 1%, an enormous structural advantage over Western counterparts where debt funding for roll-ups often exceeds 6–8%. With that spread, even moderate-value acquisitions are likely to be accretive if integration remains efficient. Investor sentiment has been volatile. The stock fell sharply from its peak of ~¥1,600 to around ¥750, reflecting skepticism about sustainability, dilution from past equity raises, and concerns that organic growth may not offset reduced deal volume. Still, the balance sheet is manageable with net debt of roughly ¥67.5 billion against an enterprise value of about ¥208 billion. The key debate is about the durability of physical entertainment demand. Domestically, arcades and karaoke have proven resilient, with stable or even improving attendance due to tourism recovery and nostalgia-driven appeal. In the U.S., the early success of GENDA’s small-format model suggests there is growth potential if execution holds. But structural risks remain: shifts in consumer behavior, weaker same-store sales once novelty fades, or missteps in integration could all limit scalability. At roughly 7.5× forward EV/EBITDA and a market capitalization of ~¥135 billion, GENDA is not priced as a high-growth compounder. Yet its unique combination of low-cost financing, accretive acquisitions, and proven unit-level economics in both Japan and the U.S. gives it a differentiated profile among global entertainment operators. If management delivers consistent free cash flow while maintaining disciplined M&A, a re-rating toward historical multiples (even modestly, say 10–12×) could be justified. The case for GENDA, therefore, rests less on aggressive forecasts and more on execution consistency: can they integrate at scale, allocate capital prudently, and sustain the profitability of the physical platforms that underpin Japanese entertainment culture? I am very interested to see what others think. I have been looking at different (Japenese) small caps for a while now and am particularly excited about this stock. Whilst it might not be a typical value play being a roll-up/growth company, I'd argue the current valuation assuming little further growth already seems quite attractive. Would be very interested to hear what other think.", "title": "GENDA (TSE:9166): Japanese arcade roll-up organically doubling sales in the US", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ok3kzx/genda_tse9166_japanese_arcade_rollup_organically/", "author": "Nebikiya", "score": 6, "subreddit": "stocks", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T00:23:28.092169"}

It’s been around forever as the go to online checkout, though now there are other options like Apple Pay, Zelle and more. PayPal also owns Venmo. Growth hasn’t been huge. Year over year user growth is only around 1 percent, so it’s not exactly the hottest stock in the market. But, I think that will re-accelerate. But last week, PayPal announced a partnership with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. ChatGPT has a billion active users who will now be able to easily buy and sell through ChatGPT using PayPal. Even better, eligible transactions come with PayPal’s Purchase Protection and Seller Protection. This means users get the convenience of PayPal’s wallet in Instant Checkout, with multiple funding options like bank, balance, or card, plus tracking, dispute resolution, and all the protections PayPal buyers and sellers value. PayPal will also connect its global merchant network to OpenAI, creating a platform for tens of millions of small businesses as well as the largest brands in the world to sell within ChatGPT. I think this has the potential to add a ton of new active users for PayPal, growth that the market isn’t currently pricing in. Right now, PayPal trades at a PE of 13.25, which is really cheap. Forward PE is 11.9. They are also putting all of their free cash flow into buying back shares, rewarding shareholders consistently. On average, they increase the supply by just 10 percent per year, so shareholders see real value. The CEO is young and forward thinking. He even consults his kids, who are in college, on trends in AI and how to push Venmo and other innovations. I think PayPal is well-positioned to be one of the winners as AI becomes a bigger part of commerce.

I'm sure like 5 people remember my last post from a year ago where I broke down my entire strategy. I won't be doing that again, but here's an update on how it performed. Overall up +32% which is slightly better than QQQ's +29%. I didn't even come close to TQQQ's +63% this time around and the cause is pretty clear... XLP flopped big time. I know it's a hedge so in a way it's supposed to underperform when everything is at all time highs but to underperform THIS much? It felt like I was hedging my calls with puts. I could speculate that there's some global macroeconomic shift away from consumer staples or something but I didn't get here by doing that kind of DD. I just backtested historical returns. https://preview.redd.it/8oih97uutgyf1.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=99e35321eff36d599934739ea8de4f8d9c0227c1 On an unrelated note, I find it hilarious that some haters bookmarked my post and showed up to say \"told you so\" around liberation day. Yeah I was down -$167k at the time but I've seen worse and that ended up being a nothing burger. Turns out when your calls have 1-2 years until expiry those temporary setbacks don't matter much. Moving forward, I think I'm done with options. I'm sure we've all seen those posts where people hit it big and make life changing money but don't know when to quit. There's this dismissive attitude like \"if you can't quit your day job right this instant then it's not enough money\" but that's just not true. All time (since 2018) I'm up +$415k which is a massive head start and is plenty to snowball into retirement from here even in shares. Maybe if my goal were to hit a high score of millions of dollars I'd keep YOLOing 50% of my portfolio into LEAPS every year but I just want a comfy normal life. https://preview.redd.it/q6lgexe0vgyf1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b663478b678b636f52228f06b7ccf47cce7e70 If you backtest retirement strategies (which I've done a lot of) the ones that fail happen when you hit your target number due to some bubble, quit your job, then immediately stuff crashes back down like in 2000 or 2008. Moving to safer investments early and planning to work a while longer should both protect against that in case we're in a bubble right now. It's been fun. We'll see if I have anything worth posting next year but probably not.

The S&P 500 just posted a new ATH 3 days ago, with nearly 400 of the companies closing in red. These news were disturbing to me. I have always been passive investor, trying to have the least possible number of sales and purchases as possible, to filter out noise, and follow my convictions. This, however, got me thinking. This is not normal, and can't be justified in the eyes of time. I know, I know - \"this time it's different\". Romans thought it too. It's not normal for a single company to have a valuation equal to nearly 1/6th of the GDP of USA. It is NOT normal. It's not sustainable. It does not create 1/6th of the value in the country. People don't eat it, drink it, or live in it. It's products are not 1/6th of your life or used 1/6th of your time. It's not normal for 10 companies to pull the entire index up, while the others are stagnating or declining. I have neither the personal analysis, nor the necessary skillset, or even just the sheer time to make a detailed analysis of the performance of each of the 500, but my conviction, based on my speculation and far-gaze is that the money are flowing in fomo to the hottest potato on the market, and, at least in my mind, there is a doubt, that the red is not based on (just, if any) the poor performance, management or sales of those 490 companies, but rather is capital being redirected to the forerunners, that have more and more ungodly expectations for performance bestowed upon them each new day, and these new and outlandish expectations are already priced in, and being upped with each new hype (Notice I didn't say pump. But really wanted to.) AI. The buzzword. The new hegemon. And don't get me wrong. I see it. I believe in it. I think, no, I am convinced we're on the verge of an Era. And AI is not the Era itself, it's just a corner stone, a building block of it. A big one, maybe the biggest, but not the entire thing. The humanity is on the doorstep of, most probably, the last epoch that we will see slavery again. And this time, we will convince ourselves, as spicies, that this slavery is different (mhm, again). It's not inhumane, because the slaves will be made of metal and circuits. Slaves that don't drink, sleep or eat, that don't have free will, and are, literally, created and programed for whatever we want. \"And it's not inhumane\" humanity will cheer. Anybody played Detroit:Become Human? That's what happens after. But while we get to the Detroit scenario, imagine the progress. Imagine being able to create a factory, that builds cars, or toys, or whatever your heart desires, filled with workers, that costed you a one time payment of a price, equal to around one-year salary for a human worker. And that factory works 24/7, with no recurring costs, other than maintenance and utilities. It's happening. Right now. But it's happening slow. Slower than we wish, slower than we hope, and more diversified, than we can imagine. Or at least than I can imagine. Maybe you're better than me. And it's not a single company, that will do it. Remember Cisco ($NASDAQ:CSCO)? They were gonna run the internet themselves. 25 years later, they're still below their ATH. It's the world, that's gonna do it. The companies that are producing the best examples are still not even public yet (Yes, I'm looking at you, Figure8). We have extreme expectations, priced in in a handful of companies. Behemots of industry, with uber-large staffing, rigid framework and heavy beaurocratic procedures, because this is what happens when you're a behemot of industry. It's how the world turns, ever since the Romans, because it's just how it works, if you want to command a large structure. And large and rigid structures are slow. Slow to innovate, slow to adapt, slow to move, because they are large. Swans and innovation come from small, nimble and adaptive organisms, because they can leap like no one else. And when someone strikes the gold vein, and skyrokets, they stop innovating, and start building rigidity, predictability and dependability. At least in my view, that is. What is my thesis? This concentartion is not sustainable. Those valuations are outlandish, and those promises and expecations are unkeepable. It's not normal, and it should bother you. It should bother all of us. Eggs in one basket, ever heard the telling? The world is more than AI or robotics, and that's coming from me, and I am heavily invested in tech. And sooner or later, the world is gonna have a sobering slap and remember it. I don't know when it's gonna be, but my speculation is that it will start with broken promises. Lack of adoption or enougu real world applications, that will make the doubts creep in under the itchy skin of Mr. Market. And then, oh my. Saying all of that, I am here to actually ask a question. These news were bothering to me, and got me thinking: Isn't it prudent to sell the winners and buy the underdogs when they're undervalued? Sounds 'bout right to me. I did a bit of research with Perplexity AI (hehe, the irony, eh?), and then double checked, and it turns out, historically Equal Weight 500 was beating Market Weight, by a good margin (+3-4% annually, IIRC). Last 10 years are a different story though. And now, we have the biggest, visible divergence of the two, widening the gap visually on the chart, from 2014 until now. I am quoting 2014 because this is the starting point of the ETF I am looking at: $XETR:XDEW . Currently, I hold my S&P position entirely in $XETR:SXR8 . https://preview.redd.it/qkcphsjdefyf1.png?width=3202&format=png&auto=webp&s=407ef7f7d68b9b5c9c72948d855f4e94fcfdf3dd I am thinking... Should I switch from $XETR:SXR8 to $XETR:XDEW and bet on mean reversion? Perplexity told me I'm right, but to be fair, would you believe a slave's praise to it's master? I wouldn't. Strategy is to track conecntration and breadth, and hold $XETR:XDEW while the capital within the 500 restructures, and then switch to market cap again, once the dust has settled, and the hangover from the sobering up has passed. I am really eager to hear opinions on this. I am not sure about it. I am sure about the part that's not normal, but I am not sure on what's the best strategy to deal with it, and as passively as possible. I am not convinced that I want to be the dumb roommate and miss the party too. So... That's my 5 cents :) Looking for yours", "title": "Is it time to switch from Market Cap to Equal Weight 500?

{"id": "1okawh4", "created_at": "2025-10-30T20:34:10Z", "text": "These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days. This is why you can’t predict the markets. I made predictions for all the stocks in my portfolio. In just 10 days, a lot of them aged badly. To myself, and to you investors, don’t try to predict the market. My thesis: **Stock Positions 10/20/2025** **GOOG:** **Hold** after earnings when I will likely buy the stock **NEM:** While **tariffs devalue the U.S. dollar**, Gold is likely to **see record highs**. Interest rates are declining, which creates more inflation which will likely help NEM, which is a Gold miner, and gold miners are cyclical with the price of Gold. As worse data approaches the stock market (which is likely to come) Gold will keep making record highs. The USD devaluing + Interest rates likely being cut + an overvalued stock market + most other markets being overvalued is likely to allow NEM and Gold to continue to go up. Even though NEM has a large connection to Gold, NEM still must abide **by regulations** which could drag down the price, even if Gold is going up. Also, my MSR ratio shows NEM at 82/16 odds, which shows that NEM is highly overvalued on the (D) chart on TradingView. However, NEM has good leadership, and their **debt has reduced by 8.69B to 7.13B** (as of June 2025). Their debt-to-equity ratio is sound at 0.24. This is why I will **hold** NEM and wait for more earnings which are on Oct 23 2025 **NFLX:** Likely to continue with strong growth through Q3. Many analysts rate NFLX a buy before earnings and are increasing their price targets, especially after the release of some big hits (Squid Game 3, Kpop Demon Hunters). However, NFLX has fallen below its 50-day moving average of tomorrow’s earnings report. This should initiate caution to investors. Q3 has been a very good season for companies in the S&P 500. Out of the index, **12% of companies have had their earnings, with 86% surpassing expectations**. So far, this has been a fantastic quarter. NFLX is a big company and it’s likely to have a beat as well. Even though Q3 has been a good performance, **NFLX is exposed to the American consumer**, which if they feel the effects of inflation too harshly, might start to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. Also, Donald Trump, the president of the U.S said that he will **put 100% tariffs** on movies outside of the U.S, which would drastically affect NFLX’s profit margins, because **59% of all Netflix revenue comes from international markets.** Despite this, I believe that NFLX will continue to thrive and will likely beat earnings. This is why I will **buy** some NFLX before earnings tomorrow. **MU:** Earnings were fantastic. **Revenue surged up to 37.8B, nearly a 49% increase year-over-year.** Analyst targets range from $240 to $270, which is approximately a 20 – 30% upside. Although a fantastic earnings report, MU plans to **sever its chip business in China** after its ban in 2023 on its products in infrastructure. While it will still supply some things to China, this will likely, over **the long term hurt, revenue and revenue diversification**. MU has also been facing tariff headwinds **after the U.S added 10% universal tariffs** on all imports, which MU has suffered from. This is why I will **hold** until geopolitical tensions decrease. **If they increase, I will sell a chunk of my position**. I have already made 33% profit at the time of writing. **UNH:** One of the biggest healthcare / insurance service companies in the U.S, with exposure across insurance (UnitedHealthcare), health services, data and pharmacy benefits. This means it has multiple levers for revenue and margin improvement. It is an established network, relationships with other companies have been built over many decades (since 1977) **Investors like Warren Buffett and Michael Burry** have invested billions into UNH, seeing it as undervalued from recent highs. However, there is a reason for UNH being valued as ‘undervalued’. UNH have been facing rising medical costs, utilization and squeezed margins. The company has faced **a lot of uncertainty**, even at one point **suspending its 1-year outlook**. The company has faced **ongoing scrutiny into the investigation of Medicare billing practices and over adjustments**. This could bring **potential fines, reputational damages or operational constraints**. **The UNH CEO, who was shot in December 2024** caused turmoil in the company. Even though it’s been nine months since the shooting, it has scarred many investors, and customers about why the CEO was shot, and if UNH is doing bad practices at the company. For these reasons, I will likely **hold** the stock for the foreseeable future. **JNJ:** The stock has seen a good Q3 report, **sales up 6.8% year over year**. The growth came from its **“Innovative Medicine” and “MedTech”** segments, so its not overly reliant on one division. JNJ is also pushing new therapies into the markets, so its business is diverse. JNJ also revised down its **tariff expectations from $400M to $200M**, reflecting improved global trade conditions. The reason why I bought JNJ in the first place was because it was reliable and solid. It helped me hedge against market geopolitical volatility. Even though I like JNJ stock very much, key drugs **like Stelara (which is a big revenue driver) is losing its exclusivity or facing biosimilar competition** which could erode further revenue. After a strong run for JNJ, positive news might be priced in. Some valuation models say that **JNJ might be 4-5% overvalued** relative to its fundamentals. **In the worst-case scenario**, if a court hands down a massive talc verdict, or series of judgements JNJ could suffer an **earnings shock, cash flow and reputation**. This should keep investors cautioned of the future of JNJ. I will **hold** JNJ for these reasons until **further** **notice**. **BABA:** This stock has a lot of exposure to the AI market, **building the ‘compute’ layer**, which is for LLMs. It is e-commerce, but it could expand into technology through this. The stock has rallied in 2025, and some models **suggest that BABA is still undervalued**. BABA has **substantial cash reserves** for extra projects that could fuel revenue growth. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S and China has made created trouble for BABA. U.S scrutiny **because of U.S national security** concerns has impacted the valuation of the stock. While AI growth is exciting, Alibaba’s traditional services are under margin pressure. China is **dealing with a slowdown in economic growth, property stress and consumer spending being soft in many areas. Trade tensions may disrupt Alibaba**. Alibaba is also **viewed as a “comeback” and “transformation story”**, so there are high expectations, like any AI stock. Some analysts suggest most of the good news is already priced in. This is why I am going to **hold Alibaba until 11/21/2025**, when it has its earnings, and then I will do another analysis on the company then. **TSM:** This stock **manufactures** a large share of all **the most advanced chips in the world**, for big players **like NVDA and AMD**. Because it has such a large share, it has greater area **for growth and revenue expansion**. TSM has a moat in advanced technology which is extremely hard to replicate. **The accelerating demand for GPUs, AI accelerators, data centre chips, and related semiconductors benefits TSM**. TSM has had strong recent earnings. The leading edge that TSM has is **extraordinarily** **expensive to maintain**, for a company like TSM. If demand slows, then as the whole operation is so expensive, it could hurt TSM profitability. Geopolitical situation in Taiwan is delicate, because **if China declares war on Taiwan, the stock will likely drop a lot**. Cybersecurity and hacking is also meaningful in the semi conductor industry. Competition to remain the company with the most advanced chips is fierce, with Intel saying it will invest 33B euros and Samsung investing 11 – 16B dollars annually. I believe that TSM will continue to grow (no signs of growth slowing down) but if the AI bubble pops, and as China – US tensions grow (especially over Taiwan and tariffs) an invasion into Taiwan is not off the table. This is why I am cautious of TSMC’s future prospects. I am planning **to hold and buy small chunks** because of this earnings report and because of Post-Earnings-Announcement-Drift which will likely last a few more weeks. **MS:** The stock recently had a good Q3 performance, with their investment banking **revenue jumping 44% year over year. MS has also been given more flexibility to deploy capital, increase dividends or make investments, because the Federal Reserve has agreed to lower MS’ “stress capital buffer” from 5.1%, to 4.3% for the upcoming year.** Morgan Stanley is a big company, which has many diversified operations, like asset management, institutional securities, investment banking, trading and other operations which allows for multiple angles to expand revenue. However, much of their revenue comes from investment banking, so if just a handful of operations underperform, it could **affect MS and drag on profit margins**. MS is also exposed to the health **of credit markets** and the health of corporates, so if credit defaults rise, MS could face losses. Morgan Stanely would also be hurt, in the worst-case scenario, by a recession. In a recession, deal making, a large revenue driver would be hurt hart, causing a drag on MS. Given the moderate chance by most institutions of a recession coming in 2025/2026, trimming the position of MS might be a good idea. This is why I will **hold** until **recession fears are larger**. **JPM:** Similar to Morgan Stanley. I will **hold** until recession fears are larger. **UBER:** Uber has a **diversified business model**, (uber eats, normal driving, and AI services). This helps mitigate the risks associated with any single revenue stream. UBER faces regulatory scrutiny because of some drivers not being licensed. In Hong Kong, lawmakers have passed a bill to regulate this. **The FTC has taken action against UBER for deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its subscription, Uber One**. The legal challenge could result in fines and damage to Uber’s reputation. **Uber faces competition from Deliveroo and Just Eat, especially in the U.K.** This is why I will likely **hold, and if earnings are bad, sell some of my position.** **SPGI:** Standard and Poor’s. Had a good Q2 performance of 3.755B, a **6% increase year over year. The company also announced a 1.8B acquisition of With Intelligence, a private markets data provider. This will enhance SPGIs offerings, in the rapidly growing private financial market sector. Analysts maintain a “strong buy” rating for SPGI, with a 12-month price target averaging 609$ indicating a potential upside of \\~28%.** SPGI’s valuations are concerning. **The P/E ratio is at 36.3x,** which is above the industry average of 25.7x. DCF model suggest that a fair, closer value is 288$, indicating the stock may be overvalued. Like MS and JPM, market downturns could reduce demand for SPGI services and seeing as a recession has a moderate chance for 2025/2026, this is a possibility. Even though SPGI has concerning valuations, I think that I will allocate a large amount of money to SPGI before earnings. Right now, it is down -11% in my portfolio, but to me it, it suggests a buying opportunity, and as the stock has gone down a lot, the expectations for Q3 might be lower**. I will buy moderate chunks more SPGI**. Earnings on the 30^(th) of October 2025 **BKNG:** Earnings on the 28^(th) of October 2025. Booking Holdings has demonstrated **good financial results, with revenue growth being in the travel sector. BKNG is diversified, having many brands such as** [**Booking.com**](http://Booking.com)**, Agoda, KAYAK and OpenTable, providing a broad range of services. The company has operations in 220 countries, meaning that it has a strong global presence.** Booking Holdings is exposed to currency exchange rate volatility, which may impact revenue. BKNG is also very economically sensitive, so in a recession, it is likely to be impacted very hard. An economic downturn is likely not good for BKNG. **The industry is highly competitive, with players like Expedia, Airbnb and other regional platforms wanting market share. BKNG has a beta of 1.35, so it’s more volatile than other stocks.** For these reasons, I will buy **a small amount of BKNG before earnings.** **BRK.B:** 70% increase in profits in operating earnings, driven by a substantial rise in insurance. Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&P 500. I am not holding it to outperform the S&P 500, I am more holding it as a counterweight to more volatile stocks in my portfolio. Warren Buffet stepped down in 2025 which has been an issue for some investors, but I am confident in the leadership of Greg Abel. BRK.B is a very small position in my portfolio (because of Warren Buffet stepping down, and that turbulence) but the dust has likely settled, so I will **buy large chunks before earnings** (which is on the 3^(rd) of November, 2025). **DOW:** This stock has a strong history of dividends, which is why I bought it in the first place. It has a diverse revenue stream from multiple angles. The company is facing many lawsuits over misleading investors that it could withstand tariffs and sustain dividends. Analysts project that DOW **will have a loss of 0.31$** a share, a significant decline from the same quarter last year, that yielded positive profit per share. This is why I will likely **hold DOW through earnings, and see where things stand after earnings.** **OPEN:** Meme stock / speculative. **Hold / Sell before earnings report with the way things are going.** **AVGO: Strong Q3 performance, revenue of 15.95B, a 22% increase year over year. AI semiconductor revenue has surged to 63% year over year to 5.2B dollars, marking 10 consecutive quarters of growth.** AVGO has **a high P/E ratio of 89.3**, amidst this AI bubble, which is **worrying investors**. The company has also **had layoffs affecting sales, customer success, and account management roles, including VMware, which it acquired in late 2023. Even though AVGO had strong revenue, the stock still declined 4% following because it was not a good enough earnings report to please investors.** This is why I am **likely to hold till the next earnings report**. **NVDA:** Like AVGO, but they work in slightly different areas. **P/E ratio is 52, and the stock will be a hold until earnings.** **Sorry for the long essay!**", "title": "These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days.

They own Quest, OWYN, and Atkins brands of diet/health food. Stock is down big on a market overreaction to most recent ER. Company reported a paper loss of .12, but it’s all an accounting thing. They would have reported a profit of .45 or so, but they reassessed the value of their Atkins brand to be $60m lower than they were currently valuing it on the books. Revenue is in line, operating costs are in line mostly, marketing was a 9m savings over PY and they would have made 45m or so in profit if they didn’t assess down by 60m on the brands value for a 15m or so loss. OK, so I’m a degenerate and I was scrolling the 52 week new lows list looking for penny stock runners (if you haven’t noticed, every 150% top daily gainer this month has hit a 52 week low a few days prior). Anyways I scroll past this stock SMPL that is new to me, trading near $20. Ok I’m intrigued. So I check the chart and it’s decent, with a big drop in the past few days. Ok, what’s that. ER miss. Ok. What do they do? HOLY SHIT ITS QUEST BARS. Ok ok slow down. Check the financials and I’m surprised to see a healthy company on fundamental levels. Good earnings, profitable, healthy debt to assets, and just one big miss this quarter. Interesting, I wonder what happened so I go to the P&L and run down it quick. Healthy revenue, healthy cost of goods, 9m in saving YOY in marketing costs, good gross profit, and a single $60m charge for impairments. Weird. So I dig deeper a bit into their latest 10k to see what that is, and it’s a paper cost for a lowered asset valuation on Atkins, so their 45m or so in profit turns to a 15m loss, because accounting stuff. Alright the market overreacted to a paper loss when the normal business is solid as hell. Simply Good Foods (SMPL) reported a Q4 GAAP loss per share of $0.12, but this is entirely due to a one-time, non-cash impairment of about $60 million tied to re-valuing the Atkins brand and other intangible assets. Position: I’m in for $50k in shares and $1000 in options so far. Screenshots in comments. This one’s gonna be a banger. Should be worth $25-30 or more in my opinion, and OWYN brand (allergen free protein shakes and powder) is a huge growth opportunity.

Frequently Asked Questions    Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction Table Based on meticulous analysis and market trends, the table below outlines the average prices for TON from 2024 to 2050:  What Is Toncoin (TON)? Toncoin is a cryptocurrency functioning within a multichain project, is engineered for swift transactions and is supported by the open TON community. Initially conceived by the Durov brothers in 2018 for rapid transactions, Toncoin has expanded into a versatile platform accommodating various applications, from noncustodial wallets to decentralized exchanges and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With its proprietary TON wallet, users can execute prompt and secure blockchain-based payments without intermediaries. It operates within the Open Network blockchain, employing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model to ensure scalability and security for potentially millions of users. Will Toncoin Go Past All-Time Highs?&nbsp; With the TON all-time high recorded at $7.65 on Apr. 11, 2024 and the current price at $6.39, investors are curious about its potential to surpass previous highs. CertiK&#8217;s recognition of the Toncoin blockchain as the world&#8217;s fastest network further enhances TON prospects, outpacing renowned blockchains like Solana and Polygon. This achievement underscores the network&#8217;s robustness, hinting at potential price gains. Considering TON’s positive momentum, a high percentage of profitable holders, and its unparalleled network speed, there appears to be room for growth based on both pattern and market sentiment. However, it&#8217;s essential to remain vigilant of potential selling pressure, especially if it coincides with any weakening of the current uptrend signals identified through technical analysis. By closely monitoring these factors, investors can better gauge TON’s trajectory and assess its potential to surpass all-time highs. Will Toncoin Reach $10? TON’s trajectory toward reaching $10 is influenced by several key factors, including its recent performance and market dynamics. Over the past 30 days, TON has displayed a upward trend, experiencing a surge of 5.35%. This surge can be attributed to significant developments, such as Binance&#8217;s introduction of perpetual futures trading for the TON token, amplifying investor interest and driving up its value.&nbsp; Telegram Messenger&#8217;s decision to compensate channel owners with cryptocurrency has added to the momentum, fostering a positive outlook for Toncoin&#8217;s future. With such momentum, the outlook for TON price is optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential climb to $9.22 by the end of the month, representing a substantial 44.29% increase from its current price. In the mid-term, investors are bullish and optimistic that the recent progress in the project and overall boom structure in the market will lead the project to $10 on the second quarter of this year. Despite the promising trajectory, it&#8217;s essential to approach price predictions with caution, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While TON’s recent performance and positive news may fuel optimism, investors should conduct thorough market analysis and adhere to sound investment strategies to navigate uncertainties and fluctuations effectively. Toncoin Price History and Market Position Over its history, TON has demonstrated a robust performance in the cryptocurrency market. With an all-time high of $7.65 recorded on Apr. 11, 2024, and a current price of $6.39, TON has exhibited substantial growth potential. The cryptocurrency experienced an all-time low of $0.3906 on Sept. 20, 2021, demonstrating significant volatility over time. Presently, TON holds a market cap of $22.28 billion, ranking it No. 9 in terms of market capitalization. The circulating supply stands at 3,474,564,734 TON, with a total supply of 5,106,856,086 TON. The fully diluted market cap is estimated at $32.7 billion. Analyzing TON historical price trends shows a clear indication of an upward trajectory, with recent forecasts suggesting a potential surge to $8.18 and even $10 by the end of 2024. Toncoin operates in a competitive landscape, facing rivalry from decentralized layer-1 blockchains and cryptocurrencies offering similar features. Competitors such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) pose significant challenges, focusing on scalability, decentralized applications and smart contracts. Despite the competition, TON’s current market position, price performance and trading volume signal optimism for its future growth. The recent surge in trading volume, coupled with high profitability among holders and positive technical analysis signals, indicates potential for continued upward momentum. Investors are advised to monitor market trends and competitor activities closely to capitalize on TON’s growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.

Bearish Long-Term Price Prediction for Toncoin Despite numerous optimistic projections, there are also some bearish long-term price predictions for TON.

A team of seasoned analysts with expertise in cryptocurrency market dynamics backs its predictions. Price Prediction, on the other hand, employs similar methodologies to generate forecasts, aiming to provide valuable insights to investors and traders.

With forecasts suggesting values around $5 to $10 by 2026 and 2027, investors may need to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions regarding TON for their long-term portfolios. 2025 Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction  2030 Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction  Where to Buy Toncoin (TON) TON can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, Bybit, Gate.io, KuCoin, Exmo, BitMart, Bitget, Bitfinex, BigONE, HitBTC, EXOLO, XT.COM, LBank, BingX, tokenize.exchange, Coinsbit, CoinW, CoinEx, BTSE, BitoPro, CoinDCX, Richamster, NovaDAX, and Poloniex.&nbsp; Each exchange offers different features, fees and user experiences, so it&#8217;s essential to research and compare them based on your preferences and requirements before making a decision.&nbsp;           Best For API Trading   Overall Rating            Read Review      get started  securely through ByBit&#8217;s website   More  Details          Best For API Trading    N/A    1 Minute Review Founded in 2018, Bybit is a Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange offering derivatives in 17 different trading pairs.

Frequently Asked Questions    Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction Table Based on meticulous analysis and market trends, the table below outlines the average prices for TON from 2024 to 2050:  What Is Toncoin (TON)? Toncoin is a cryptocurrency functioning within a multichain project, is engineered for swift transactions and is supported by the open TON community. Initially conceived by the Durov brothers in 2018 for rapid transactions, Toncoin has expanded into a versatile platform accommodating various applications, from noncustodial wallets to decentralized exchanges and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With its proprietary TON wallet, users can execute prompt and secure blockchain-based payments without intermediaries. It operates within the Open Network blockchain, employing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model to ensure scalability and security for potentially millions of users. Will Toncoin Go Past All-Time Highs?&nbsp; With the TON all-time high recorded at $7.65 on Apr. 11, 2024 and the current price at $6.39, investors are curious about its potential to surpass previous highs. CertiK&#8217;s recognition of the Toncoin blockchain as the world&#8217;s fastest network further enhances TON prospects, outpacing renowned blockchains like Solana and Polygon. This achievement underscores the network&#8217;s robustness, hinting at potential price gains. Considering TON’s positive momentum, a high percentage of profitable holders, and its unparalleled network speed, there appears to be room for growth based on both pattern and market sentiment. However, it&#8217;s essential to remain vigilant of potential selling pressure, especially if it coincides with any weakening of the current uptrend signals identified through technical analysis. By closely monitoring these factors, investors can better gauge TON’s trajectory and assess its potential to surpass all-time highs. Will Toncoin Reach $10? TON’s trajectory toward reaching $10 is influenced by several key factors, including its recent performance and market dynamics. Over the past 30 days, TON has displayed a upward trend, experiencing a surge of 5.35%. This surge can be attributed to significant developments, such as Binance&#8217;s introduction of perpetual futures trading for the TON token, amplifying investor interest and driving up its value.&nbsp; Telegram Messenger&#8217;s decision to compensate channel owners with cryptocurrency has added to the momentum, fostering a positive outlook for Toncoin&#8217;s future. With such momentum, the outlook for TON price is optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential climb to $9.22 by the end of the month, representing a substantial 44.29% increase from its current price. In the mid-term, investors are bullish and optimistic that the recent progress in the project and overall boom structure in the market will lead the project to $10 on the second quarter of this year. Despite the promising trajectory, it&#8217;s essential to approach price predictions with caution, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While TON’s recent performance and positive news may fuel optimism, investors should conduct thorough market analysis and adhere to sound investment strategies to navigate uncertainties and fluctuations effectively. Toncoin Price History and Market Position Over its history, TON has demonstrated a robust performance in the cryptocurrency market. With an all-time high of $7.65 recorded on Apr. 11, 2024, and a current price of $6.39, TON has exhibited substantial growth potential. The cryptocurrency experienced an all-time low of $0.3906 on Sept. 20, 2021, demonstrating significant volatility over time. Presently, TON holds a market cap of $22.28 billion, ranking it No. 9 in terms of market capitalization. The circulating supply stands at 3,474,564,734 TON, with a total supply of 5,106,856,086 TON. The fully diluted market cap is estimated at $32.7 billion. Analyzing TON historical price trends shows a clear indication of an upward trajectory, with recent forecasts suggesting a potential surge to $8.18 and even $10 by the end of 2024. Toncoin operates in a competitive landscape, facing rivalry from decentralized layer-1 blockchains and cryptocurrencies offering similar features. Competitors such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) pose significant challenges, focusing on scalability, decentralized applications and smart contracts. Despite the competition, TON’s current market position, price performance and trading volume signal optimism for its future growth. The recent surge in trading volume, coupled with high profitability among holders and positive technical analysis signals, indicates potential for continued upward momentum. Investors are advised to monitor market trends and competitor activities closely to capitalize on TON’s growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.

Myro (MYRO), a meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain in November 2023, is inspired by Solana cofounder Raj Gokal’s dog. Built on Solana’s efficient proof-of-participation network boasting 10,000 nodes globally, Myro facilitates swift, tax-free transactions appealing to a broad audience. While rooted in meme culture, Myro distinguishes itself by leveraging the Solana blockchain’s capabilities and fostering community engagement.&nbsp; Beyond its playful origins, Myro aims to provide practical utility through exclusive merchandise, event access and innovative tools like the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App to bridge the gap between meme-driven hype and real-world application.&nbsp;       Table of contents [Show]     2025 Myro Price Prediction   2026 Myro Price Prediction   2030 Myro Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Myro   Factors That Could Slow Myro&#8217;s Growth   Price Predictions from Analysts   Market Sentiment and Social Trends   Speculative Demand and Hype Cycles   Broader Market Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 Myro Price Prediction  Technical indicators reflect a bearish sentiment and the Fear &amp; Greed Index has an Extreme Fear reading of 25.  Despite the long-term price prediction, CoinCodex’s analysis suggests that purchasing Myro now may not be advisable. 2026 Myro Price Prediction  For 2026, February is predicted to be the most bullish month, potentially seeing a 178.43% price increase from its current value.  2030 Myro Price Prediction  By 2030, Myro is projected to grow substantially, with the forecast implying a potential return on investment of 353.67%, reflecting a strongly bullish sentiment for the year. Reasons to Invest in Myro Myro’s integration with the Solana blockchain, its community-driven nature and the possibility of high returns associated with meme coin volatility are among the reasons to invest in it. Investors should consider:  Solana Blockchain Integration: Myro’s foundation on the Solana blockchain provides potential advantages in terms of transaction speed and efficiency. Solana’s high throughput and low fees contribute to Myro’s usability and appeal.&nbsp; Utility and Development: The project’s efforts to develop practical utilities such as the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App could move the token beyond meme status. If these features gain traction, they could add real-world value to it.&nbsp; Potential for High Returns: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and meme coins in particular can experience significant price swings. While investing in meme coins is risky, it is also possible to see substantial returns for those who time their investments well.&nbsp;  Factors That Could Slow Myro’s Growth Because it’s a meme coin, Myro is volatile with values heavily influenced by fleeting hype and speculative trends. If the initial enthusiasm declines or if negative sentiment takes hold, Myro’s price could experience a sharp decline. The perception of meme coins as purely speculative assets could deter serious long-term investors and limit sustained growth. Myro’s dependence on the Solana blockchain also makes it vulnerable – any issues affecting the Solana network, such as outages or security breaches, could impact Myro’s performance. Although the project is trying to transcend its meme status through initiatives like the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App, the success of the features is uncertain. If Myro fails to deliver on these promises or there is not sustained user engagement, its growth could be hindered. Price Predictions from Analysts According to CoinCodex, Myro’s price history reveals a significant range, reaching its all-time high of $0.445979 on March 9, 2024, after hitting an all-time low of $0.002125 on Nov. 14, 2023. Since its peak, Myro’s lowest price point was $0.010249 (cycle low) and its highest price since that low was $0.013344 (cycle high). The Myro price prediction is bearish with the Fear &amp; Greed Index indicating a level of fear at 43.&nbsp; Myro’s circulating supply is 944.2 million MYRO out of a maximum supply of 1 billion MYRO. Regarding market capitalization, Myro has notable positions in the Solana ecosystem, ranking No. 12 in the Solana Network sector, No. 96 in the Meme Coins sector and No. 58 in the broader Solana Coins &amp; Tokens sector.&nbsp; Market Sentiment and Social Trends According to Coinbase (as of April 11), MYRO generated moderate social media discussion, with 423 unique individuals contributing to online conversations, placing it at No. 165 regarding overall mentions and activities. News coverage of Myro has declined, with zero recent news articles published. On X, sentiment leans toward neutrality with 89.61% of posts expressing a neutral stance. Bullish sentiment accounts for 10.39% of posts while bearish sentiment represents only 0.73% based on a sample of 915 posts. Reddit posts tended to have more downvotes than upvotes while comments tended to receive more upvotes than downvotes. Speculative Demand and Hype Cycles Like many meme coins, Myro experiences significant price fluctuations driven by speculative demand and hype cycles which are characterized by rapid price surges fueled by social media buzz, influencer endorsements and the fear of missing out. A surge of interest can attract more investors and drive the price higher. Still, the rallies are often unsustainable because they are not usually based on fundamental value or long-term utility.&nbsp; As hype subsides, speculative demand declines leading to sharp price corrections. This volatility makes Myro a high-risk investment where timing is crucial. Investors who capitalize on hype cycles should know the potential for substantial losses because the market can shift abruptly.&nbsp; Broader Market Factors MYRO’s price movements are also influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions including Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, Federal Reserve policies and overall risk appetite in the crypto market. Historically, meme coins have closely followed Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory, so MYRO will likely see a speculative interest surge if BTC enters a bull market. Conversely, meme coins suffer heavier losses than more fundamentally driven assets during bearish market conditions.

If Myro fails to deliver on these promises or there is not sustained user engagement, its growth could be hindered. Price Predictions from Analysts According to CoinCodex, Myro’s price history reveals a significant range, reaching its all-time high of $0.445979 on March 9, 2024, after hitting an all-time low of $0.002125 on Nov. 14, 2023. Since its peak, Myro’s lowest price point was $0.010249 (cycle low) and its highest price since that low was $0.013344 (cycle high). The Myro price prediction is bearish with the Fear &amp; Greed Index indicating a level of fear at 43.&nbsp; Myro’s circulating supply is 944.2 million MYRO out of a maximum supply of 1 billion MYRO. Regarding market capitalization, Myro has notable positions in the Solana ecosystem, ranking No. 12 in the Solana Network sector, No. 96 in the Meme Coins sector and No. 58 in the broader Solana Coins &amp; Tokens sector.&nbsp; Market Sentiment and Social Trends According to Coinbase (as of April 11), MYRO generated moderate social media discussion, with 423 unique individuals contributing to online conversations, placing it at No. 165 regarding overall mentions and activities. News coverage of Myro has declined, with zero recent news articles published. On X, sentiment leans toward neutrality with 89.61% of posts expressing a neutral stance. Bullish sentiment accounts for 10.39% of posts while bearish sentiment represents only 0.73% based on a sample of 915 posts. Reddit posts tended to have more downvotes than upvotes while comments tended to receive more upvotes than downvotes. Speculative Demand and Hype Cycles Like many meme coins, Myro experiences significant price fluctuations driven by speculative demand and hype cycles which are characterized by rapid price surges fueled by social media buzz, influencer endorsements and the fear of missing out. A surge of interest can attract more investors and drive the price higher. Still, the rallies are often unsustainable because they are not usually based on fundamental value or long-term utility.&nbsp; As hype subsides, speculative demand declines leading to sharp price corrections. This volatility makes Myro a high-risk investment where timing is crucial. Investors who capitalize on hype cycles should know the potential for substantial losses because the market can shift abruptly.&nbsp; Broader Market Factors MYRO’s price movements are also influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions including Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, Federal Reserve policies and overall risk appetite in the crypto market. Historically, meme coins have closely followed Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory, so MYRO will likely see a speculative interest surge if BTC enters a bull market. Conversely, meme coins suffer heavier losses than more fundamentally driven assets during bearish market conditions.    Frequently Asked Questions     Q   What is Myro and why is it gaining attention in the crypto market?    1 What is Myro and why is it gaining attention in the crypto market?  asked 2025-11-01  Margaret Jackson    A   1 Myro (MYRO) is a meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain in November 2023, inspired by Solana cofounder Raj Gokal’s dog. Unlike typical meme coins, Myro is developing tools like a Social-Fi app and MYRO Buy Bot to create real-world utility. Despite recent bearish momentum, its viral branding, fast Solana-based transactions and early community engagement have drawn investor interest. &nbsp;  Answer Link  answered 2025-11-01   Benzinga        Q   What are the price predictions for Myro (MYRO) in 2025?   1 What are the price predictions for Myro (MYRO) in 2025? asked 2025-11-01  Margaret Jackson    A   1 Analysts forecast MYRO could trade between $0.012285 and $0.041902 in 2025 with an average expected price of $0.024363. CoinCodex projects a 229.3% increase by May 10. However, current technical indicators are bearish and the Fear &amp; Greed Index sits at 25 (Extreme Fear) suggesting caution in the short term. &nbsp;  Answer Link  answered 2025-11-01   Benzinga        Q   Could Myro reach new highs by 2030?   1 Could Myro reach new highs by 2030? asked 2025-11-01  Margaret Jackson    A   1 By 2030, MYRO is forecast to reach as high as $0.050579 with an average price around $0.047891. This implies a potential return on investment of over 350% from current levels provided market sentiment improves and Myro delivers on its road map. A bullish scenario may unfold if broader crypto markets rally and Myro gains wider adoption.

PancakeSwap (CAKE) has long been the go-to decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, offering cheap trades, yield farming and sweet, sweet staking rewards. But while it used to dominate the DeFi leaderboard, today’s landscape is a bit less syrupy. With token emissions outpacing demand and competition heating up across L2s and altchains, CAKE’s future isn’t as cut and dry. Still, PancakeSwap is far from irrelevant. The platform continues to burn CAKE tokens, upgrade its features and remain a low-fee favorite. But the real question is whether this DEX token can reclaim its former glory or if it’ll slowly get flipped by faster, flashier competitors.       Table of contents [Show]     2025 CAKE Price Prediction   2026 CAKE Price Prediction   2030 CAKE Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in PancakeSwap (CAKE)   Factors That Could Slow PancakeSwap&#8217;s Growth   Price Prediction Methodology   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends &amp; Ecosystem Analysis   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 CAKE Price Prediction  CAKE could see moderate bullish momentum in 2025. While it’s not moon-bound, the projection assumes a recovery in DEX trading volumes and DeFi user activity. If market confidence in Binance Smart Chain returns (despite Ethereum L2s eating its lunch), PancakeSwap may reestablish itself as a reliable low-fee alternative. This isn’t about hype, this is about resilience in a maturing DeFi space. The high-end estimate assumes increased staking participation, solid token burns offsetting emissions and broader BSC ecosystem growth. But it’s a tightrope walk. And one misstep (like fewer incentives or BNB ecosystem weakness) and CAKE could lose heat fast. 2026 CAKE Price Prediction  In 2026, CAKE may slide into consolidation mode. The muted outlook likely reflects market fatigue and the emergence of stronger DEX players on Ethereum rollups and modular chains. As DeFi infrastructure evolves, users demand more than swaps and syrup pools. They want real interoperability, advanced order routing and token utility that doesn’t rely solely on inflationary rewards. If PancakeSwap can adapt by integrating cross-chain functionality, launching unique DeFi tools or improving CAKE’s governance power, it may still outperform some legacy tokens. But without those upgrades, it risks becoming a second-tier player with limited upside. 2030 CAKE Price Prediction  By 2030, long-term forecasts take a bullish turn. Reasons to Invest in PancakeSwap (CAKE) For all its challenges, PancakeSwap remains one of the largest DEXs in crypto by user count and total value locked on BSC. That matters. A loyal base still farming rewards, swapping tokens and engaging with the protocol daily. CAKE also benefits from a few enduring advantages:  Low transaction fees thanks to BSC’s infrastructure Frequent token burns aimed at curbing inflation A well-known brand and user-friendly UI Continuous updates including prediction markets, gaming integrations and new staking options  For investors looking to bet on established DeFi platforms rather than risky, unproven alternatives, CAKE might still be a compelling choice especially at a discount. Factors That Could Slow PancakeSwap’s Growth CAKE’s tokenomics are a double-edged sword. While the project regularly burns a decent chunk of supply, its emissions remain high and rewards are still the primary driver of demand. That’s a tough game to win long-term. Other red flags include:  Declining BNB chain usage compared to Ethereum L2s Minimal differentiation in a crowded DEX market Risk of regulatory pressure on incentive-based platforms User migration to newer protocols offering better returns  Unless PancakeSwap seriously levels its value proposition beyond token swaps and yield farming, CAKE may slowly lose relevance to smarter, faster competitors. And if DeFi continues consolidating around a handful of ecosystems, BSC’s dominance could shrink, taking PancakeSwap with it. Price Prediction Methodology Our CAKE price forecast through 2030 combines multiple research angles to create a balanced view of its potential. Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We aggregated price predictions from trusted platforms like WalletInvestor, CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice. These forecasts provided the low, average and high estimates used in each year’s section. Market Trends &amp; Ecosystem Analysis We analyzed on-chain metrics such as user growth, total value locked and DEX trading volume across the Binance ecosystem. These data points influenced our understanding of PancakeSwap’s current standing and future outlook. Macroeconomic Factors Like all altcoins, CAKE is at the mercy of macro market conditions. Rising interest rates, tightening regulations or waning investor appetite for risk assets could hurt CAKE’s performance regardless of what’s happening on-chain. Conversely, a renewed bull market or a DeFi resurgence could breathe new life into the token.

The platform’s ability to handle high transaction volumes efficiently makes it attractive for applications like digital asset management and secure financial transactions.&nbsp; Algorand has pursued partnerships to expand its ecosystem and real-world applications. Collaborations with technology companies, government entities and financial institutions are key to its growth. Partnerships aimed at developing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenizing real-world assets bring credibility and utility to the Algorand network.&nbsp; Factors That Could Slow Algorand’s Growth Alogrand growth trajectory faces headwinds from intense competition in the blockchain space where established and emerging platforms compete for dominance. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, particularly among institutional investors, could impede adoption.&nbsp; While Algorand targets institutional integration, progress is slow in this area because of concerns about security, scalability and compliance. Its less developed developer ecosystem compared to more mature platforms could also hinder the creation of dApps and use cases.&nbsp; The volatility of the cryptocurrency market can deter potential investors and users. Unforeseen technological hurdles or security vulnerabilities also could damage Alogrand’s reputation.&nbsp; Price Prediction Methodology Aggregate Analyst Forecasts To estimate Polygon’s future price, we aggregated predictions from several sources:  Wallet Investor CoinCodex Changelly CoinPedia  These forecasts factor in historical price movements, technical analysis and broader market sentiment. Given ALGO’s speculative nature, predictions vary widely, ranging from bearish estimates suggesting declines in a risk-averse market to optimistic projections anticipating new highs in a bullish cycle. Market Trends Sentiment and Social Trends Market sentiment for Algorand leans bearish, with 71% of indicators suggesting a downward trend. The Fear &amp; Greed Index registers a score of 32, indicating a state of fear among investors, according to Changelly.com. Short-term charts (four-hour and daily) show a weakening trend, with falling 50-day moving averages potentially resisting future price movements.&nbsp; The weekly timeframe presents a potentially bullish perspective. Although the 50-day moving average is above the price and rising, potentially acting as resistance, the 200-day moving average, while declining, could signal the potential for a longer-term trend reversal. This suggests that while short-term caution is warranted, there may be opportunities for a bullish reversal in the longer term.&nbsp; Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic factors play a role in shaping the landscape for cryptocurrencies like Algorand. Federal Reserve policies, particularly adjustments to interest rates, can significantly impact investor sentiment and capital flow. Increases in interest rates tend to tighten financial conditions, reducing the availability of capital for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies potentially leading to downward price pressure on ALGO. Decreases in interest rates can stimulate investment, potentially driving up ALGO’s value.&nbsp; The overall health of the global economy also influences investor behavior during economic ALGO. If traditional markets like equities and commodities experience significant declines, ALGO and other digital assets will likely follow suit.    Frequently Asked Questions     Q   How much will Algorand be worth in 2030?    1 How much will Algorand be worth in 2030?  asked 2025-11-01  Margaret Jackson    A   1 By 2030, Algorand (ALGO) is expected to trade between $0.093 (bearish) and $0.127 (bullish), with an average price prediction of $0.108. Despite market volatility, long-term projections indicate a potential 22.51% ROI, driven by Algorand’s focus on institutional adoption and real-world asset tokenization.

However, long-term speculative models suggest that if Algorand achieves widespread adoption in CBDCs and digital asset management, it could see significant price appreciation in future decades.  Answer Link  answered 2025-11-01   Benzinga        Q   What factors could impact Algorand’s growth?   1 What factors could impact Algorand’s growth? asked 2025-11-01  Margaret Jackson    A   1 Algorand future price depends on several key factors, including competition from other blockchains, regulatory uncertainty and institutional adoption. While ALGO is built for speed, security and scalability, its developer ecosystem is still less mature than Ethereum’s, which could slow growth. Additionally, macroeconomic conditions, including Federal Reserve policies and investor risk appetite, will shape ALGO’s trajectory.

Market Trends Sentiment and Social Trends Market sentiment for Algorand leans bearish, with 71% of indicators suggesting a downward trend. The Fear &amp; Greed Index registers a score of 32, indicating a state of fear among investors, according to Changelly.com. Short-term charts (four-hour and daily) show a weakening trend, with falling 50-day moving averages potentially resisting future price movements.&nbsp; The weekly timeframe presents a potentially bullish perspective. Although the 50-day moving average is above the price and rising, potentially acting as resistance, the 200-day moving average, while declining, could signal the potential for a longer-term trend reversal. This suggests that while short-term caution is warranted, there may be opportunities for a bullish reversal in the longer term.&nbsp; Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic factors play a role in shaping the landscape for cryptocurrencies like Algorand. Federal Reserve policies, particularly adjustments to interest rates, can significantly impact investor sentiment and capital flow. Increases in interest rates tend to tighten financial conditions, reducing the availability of capital for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies potentially leading to downward price pressure on ALGO. Decreases in interest rates can stimulate investment, potentially driving up ALGO’s value.&nbsp; The overall health of the global economy also influences investor behavior during economic ALGO. If traditional markets like equities and commodities experience significant declines, ALGO and other digital assets will likely follow suit.    Frequently Asked Questions     Q   How much will Algorand be worth in 2030?    1 How much will Algorand be worth in 2030?  asked 2025-11-01  Margaret Jackson    A   1 By 2030, Algorand (ALGO) is expected to trade between $0.093 (bearish) and $0.127 (bullish), with an average price prediction of $0.108.

You can trade Arweave on Coinbase—and if you&#8217;re new to the platform, you could earn up to $400 in rewards by completing a few quick educational lessons and making your first qualifying trade. Arweave (AR) is betting big on one of the most overlooked but crucial components of decentralized infrastructure: permanent data storage. Unlike traditional cloud services or even Web3 file systems like IPFS, Arweave goes all in on the promise of storing data forever.&nbsp; The protocol incentivizes a global network of storage providers using a unique endowment mechanism that frontloads the storage cost for long-term sustainability. It’s a bold approach that challenges centralized data hoarders like AWS, Dropbox and Google Cloud. If decentralization is about freedom and permanence, Arweave may be one of the few walking that talk. As AI and blockchain generate mountains of data daily, the need for immutable, tamperproof, long-term storage is only growing. The question is, will Arweave become the vault of the decentralized web or just another ambitious idea buried in digital dust?       Table of contents [Show]     2025 AR Price Prediction   2026 AR Price Prediction   2030 AR Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Arweave (AR)   Factors That Could Slow Arweave&#8217;s Growth   Price Prediction Methodology   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 AR Price Prediction  Arweave could post solid gains in 2025. The upside here isn’t driven by hype but by a slow-burning realization: the world needs somewhere to store its decentralized assets and temporary solutions won’t cut it. If Web3 adoption surges and on-chain permanence becomes a priority for developers and DAOs, Arweave could become a trusted backbone. The higher-end estimate of $10.24 assumes real traction, such as more adoption by NFT platforms, decentralized social networks like Lens or Farcaster or integrations with L2s looking to store data off chain but with permanence. Of course, to hit those numbers, Arweave will need to prove it can scale storage demand while keeping costs stable and ensuring availability. It’s one thing to sell permanence; it’s another to deliver it when data scales exponentially. 2026 AR Price Prediction  Analysis suggests the coin could surge in 2026. If the initial hype around permanent storage cools, what remains is whether real-world usage sustains the protocol. Arweave’s performance in 2026 may depend on developer onboarding and partnership integration. If new dApps begin defaulting to Arweave for data immutability (think DeFi logs, legal records or even supply chain receipts) the demand for AR could remain resilient. Otherwise, the protocol risks becoming a niche storage layer for a select few crypto-native applications. 2030 AR Price Prediction  By 2030, Arweave’s outlook is wide open. If you believe the decentralized web will need permanent, censorship-resistant data layers, Arweave could be indispensable. That high-end target assumes the protocol becomes a key pillar in crypto’s storage stack, similar to how Ethereum became synonymous with smart contracts. Permanent archiving for AI models, decentralized search engines or government transparency initiatives could all drive demand to AR. But let’s not ignore the risks. If the Web3 world opts for cheaper, more scalable alternatives like Filecoin or keeps offloading data to centralized silos, AR could struggle to justify its premium storage model. The low-end forecast of $14.40 reflects that potential downside.  Reasons to Invest in Arweave (AR) Arweave isn’t chasing fleeting narratives. It’s offering a fundamental Web3 service. Permanent, immutable data storage that few others even attempt. This long-term approach aligns with the core principles of decentralization: permanence, openness and resistance to censorship. Unlike cloud storage providers that operate on subscription models, Arweave uses a one-time fee to store data forever. This is powered by an economic model built on upfront payments and predictable token issuance. If the cost curve holds and real-world adoption increases, AR could offer both utility and scarcity. Arweave has also carved out a unique moat. Protocols like Mirror, decent.land and even Solana’s historical data storage have leveraged Arweave. That kind of usage isn’t speculative. It’s functional and growing. Factors That Could Slow Arweave’s Growth Let’s not sugarcoat it: permanent storage isn’t exactly a compelling pitch in the current hype cycle. While it’s necessary, it doesn’t spark the same kind of attention as flashy DeFi yields or AI tokens. That could hurt visibility and investment inflow. There’s also the issue of cost. Arweave’s upfront fee model makes sense for permanence but if cheaper decentralized alternatives emerge, it could be hard to justify paying now for forever, especially when “forever” might not be in the budget. Then there’s competition. Filecoin, Crust Network and even centralized giants with Web3 extensions could start nibbling at Arweave’s market share. If they offer hybrid models or better performance, Arweave might find itself priced out. Add in macroeconomic pressures and regulatory uncertainty and AR’s trajectory is anything but guaranteed. It’s not enough to be useful. You have to be compelling and that’s a higher bar to clear when the sector matures. Price Prediction Methodology Our Arweave price forecast through 2030 pulls from a combination of expert analysis, technical indicators and ecosystem growth projections. Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We used pricing insights from crypto research platforms including WalletInvestor, CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice. These informed our yearly low, average and high estimates. Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis Arweave’s core value lies in decentralized data permanence. As dApps, L2s and AI tools require immutable storage, AR’s demand could grow if it stays cost effective and developer friendly Macroeconomic Factors AR’s long-term success is tied to broader adoption of decentralized infrastructure. If capital continues flowing into foundational Web3 protocols, Arweave could see strong tailwinds. But if regulation or a shift in tech narratives sidelines permanent storage, AR might lag behind faster-moving narratives like AI, gaming or real-world assets.    Frequently Asked Questions     Q   Does Arweave have a future?    1 Does Arweave have a future?  asked 2025-11-01  Ryan Peterson    A   1 Arweave has a compelling use case as a provider of permanent decentralized storage, which may become critical infrastructure in a maturing Web3.

Unlike traditional cloud services or even Web3 file systems like IPFS, Arweave goes all in on the promise of storing data forever.&nbsp; The protocol incentivizes a global network of storage providers using a unique endowment mechanism that frontloads the storage cost for long-term sustainability. It’s a bold approach that challenges centralized data hoarders like AWS, Dropbox and Google Cloud. If decentralization is about freedom and permanence, Arweave may be one of the few walking that talk. As AI and blockchain generate mountains of data daily, the need for immutable, tamperproof, long-term storage is only growing. The question is, will Arweave become the vault of the decentralized web or just another ambitious idea buried in digital dust?       Table of contents [Show]     2025 AR Price Prediction   2026 AR Price Prediction   2030 AR Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Arweave (AR)   Factors That Could Slow Arweave&#8217;s Growth   Price Prediction Methodology   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 AR Price Prediction  Arweave could post solid gains in 2025. The upside here isn’t driven by hype but by a slow-burning realization: the world needs somewhere to store its decentralized assets and temporary solutions won’t cut it. If Web3 adoption surges and on-chain permanence becomes a priority for developers and DAOs, Arweave could become a trusted backbone. The higher-end estimate of $10.24 assumes real traction, such as more adoption by NFT platforms, decentralized social networks like Lens or Farcaster or integrations with L2s looking to store data off chain but with permanence. Of course, to hit those numbers, Arweave will need to prove it can scale storage demand while keeping costs stable and ensuring availability. It’s one thing to sell permanence; it’s another to deliver it when data scales exponentially. 2026 AR Price Prediction  Analysis suggests the coin could surge in 2026. If the initial hype around permanent storage cools, what remains is whether real-world usage sustains the protocol. Arweave’s performance in 2026 may depend on developer onboarding and partnership integration. If new dApps begin defaulting to Arweave for data immutability (think DeFi logs, legal records or even supply chain receipts) the demand for AR could remain resilient. Otherwise, the protocol risks becoming a niche storage layer for a select few crypto-native applications. 2030 AR Price Prediction  By 2030, Arweave’s outlook is wide open. If you believe the decentralized web will need permanent, censorship-resistant data layers, Arweave could be indispensable. That high-end target assumes the protocol becomes a key pillar in crypto’s storage stack, similar to how Ethereum became synonymous with smart contracts. Permanent archiving for AI models, decentralized search engines or government transparency initiatives could all drive demand to AR. But let’s not ignore the risks. If the Web3 world opts for cheaper, more scalable alternatives like Filecoin or keeps offloading data to centralized silos, AR could struggle to justify its premium storage model. The low-end forecast of $14.40 reflects that potential downside.  Reasons to Invest in Arweave (AR) Arweave isn’t chasing fleeting narratives. It’s offering a fundamental Web3 service. Permanent, immutable data storage that few others even attempt. This long-term approach aligns with the core principles of decentralization: permanence, openness and resistance to censorship. Unlike cloud storage providers that operate on subscription models, Arweave uses a one-time fee to store data forever. This is powered by an economic model built on upfront payments and predictable token issuance. If the cost curve holds and real-world adoption increases, AR could offer both utility and scarcity. Arweave has also carved out a unique moat. Protocols like Mirror, decent.land and even Solana’s historical data storage have leveraged Arweave. That kind of usage isn’t speculative. It’s functional and growing. Factors That Could Slow Arweave’s Growth Let’s not sugarcoat it: permanent storage isn’t exactly a compelling pitch in the current hype cycle. While it’s necessary, it doesn’t spark the same kind of attention as flashy DeFi yields or AI tokens. That could hurt visibility and investment inflow. There’s also the issue of cost. Arweave’s upfront fee model makes sense for permanence but if cheaper decentralized alternatives emerge, it could be hard to justify paying now for forever, especially when “forever” might not be in the budget. Then there’s competition. Filecoin, Crust Network and even centralized giants with Web3 extensions could start nibbling at Arweave’s market share. If they offer hybrid models or better performance, Arweave might find itself priced out. Add in macroeconomic pressures and regulatory uncertainty and AR’s trajectory is anything but guaranteed. It’s not enough to be useful. You have to be compelling and that’s a higher bar to clear when the sector matures. Price Prediction Methodology Our Arweave price forecast through 2030 pulls from a combination of expert analysis, technical indicators and ecosystem growth projections. Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We used pricing insights from crypto research platforms including WalletInvestor, CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice. These informed our yearly low, average and high estimates. Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis Arweave’s core value lies in decentralized data permanence. As dApps, L2s and AI tools require immutable storage, AR’s demand could grow if it stays cost effective and developer friendly Macroeconomic Factors AR’s long-term success is tied to broader adoption of decentralized infrastructure. If capital continues flowing into foundational Web3 protocols, Arweave could see strong tailwinds. But if regulation or a shift in tech narratives sidelines permanent storage, AR might lag behind faster-moving narratives like AI, gaming or real-world assets.

Feeling confident about this UNI price prediction? You can trade Uniswap on Coinbase—and if you&#8217;re new to the platform, you could earn up to $400 in rewards by completing a few quick educational lessons and making your first qualifying trade. Uniswap (UNI) is a decentralized exchange (DEX) that operates on the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike traditional exchanges, Uniswap eliminates the need for intermediaries by using an automated market maker (AMM) system that relies on smart contracts to create liquidity pools, enabling users to trade ERC-20 tokens directly with each other. Participants can contribute their cryptocurrency assets to the pools, providing liquidity and earning a portion of the trading fees. Uniswap’s governance token UNI empowers holders to participate in the platform’s decision-making processes.&nbsp;       Table of contents [Show]     2025 Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction   2026 Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction   2030 Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Uniswap   Factors that Could Slow Uniswap&#8217;s Growth   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends and Adoption Analysis   Regulatory and Legal Considerations   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction  2026 Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction  2030 Uniswap (UNI) Price Prediction  Reasons to Invest in Uniswap Uniswap is a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Ethereum network allowing users to trade ERC-20 tokens directly from their wallets. The decentralization minimizes counterparty risk and enhances security, appealing to investors who prioritize self-custody and transparency. As the decentralized finance (DeFi) sector expands, Uniswap’s established presence and robust infrastructure position it to capture a significant share of the growing trading volume.&nbsp; The UNI token offers governance rights allowing holders to participate in the platform’s decision-making process, which empowers the community to shape Uniswap’s future development. That gives holders a sense of ownership and could drive innovation. As DeFi protocols evolve, the ability to influence protocol changes and upgrades can be valuable. The accrual of fees to UNI holders in the future is also a potential benefit. The protocol can turn on fee switches, distributing a portion of trading fees to UNI holders, which could drive demand for the token and increase its value.&nbsp; Continuous innovation and development in Uniswap’s ecosystem contribute to its investment appeal. The platform’s constant evolution including developing new versions and features demonstrates its commitment to staying at the forefront of the DeFi space.&nbsp; Factors that Could Slow Uniswap’s Growth Volatility and regulatory uncertainty are a challenge for all cryptocurrencies including Uniswap. Fluctuations in the price of Ethereum, the blockchain Uniswap operates on, can impact transaction fees and user activity. The lack of clear regulatory frameworks for DeFi protocols creates a risk of future restrictions or bans that could stymie Uniswap’s adoption and development.&nbsp; Increasing competition in the DEX sector could impede Uniswap’s growth. New protocols and platforms that offer innovative features and lower fees could erode Uniswap’s market share and force it to adapt rapidly to maintain its dominance. Scalability challenges on Ethereum’s blockchain can lead to high transaction fees and low processing times, deterring users from trading on Uniswap and driving them to other platforms offering faster and cheaper transactions.&nbsp; Security vulnerabilities and smart contract risks threaten Uniswap and its users. The complexity of DeFi protocols and the potential for coding errors can lead to financial losses. While Uniswap has implemented various security measures, the risks associated with decentralized platforms are a concern. A major security breach could damage Uniswap’s reputation and erode user trust, slowing its growth and adoption.&nbsp; Aggregate Analyst Forecasts To estimate UNI’s future price, we aggregated predictions from several sources:  Wallet Investor CoinCodex Changelly CoinPedia  These forecasts factor in historical price movements, technical analysis and broader market sentiment. Given UNI’s speculative nature, predictions vary widely ranging from bearish estimates suggesting declines in a risk-averse market to optimistic projections anticipating new highs in a bullish cycle. Market Trends and Adoption Analysis As DeFi expands, Uniswap stands to benefit. Its role as a DeFi infrastructure component strengthens the platform as the sector matures. Concerns about security, privacy and censorship resistance are pushing users toward DEXs over centralized exchanges (CEXs) and Uniswap is well-positioned to capitalize on the shift. The platform’s reliance on the Ethereum blockchain connects its performance to Ethereum’s developments. Upgrades to improve scalability and reduce transaction fees impact Uniswap’s usability and the growth of the Ethereum ecosystem provides additional trading opportunities.&nbsp; The platform’s liquidity and high trading volume are big draws, attracting both traders and liquidity providers. Uniswap’s diverse user base includes experienced traders, DeFi enthusiasts and newcomers. The UNI token’s governance incentivizes community involvement.&nbsp; Regulatory and Legal Considerations Regulatory decisions substantially influence cryptocurrency prices and Uniswap is no exception.

Feeling confident about this ADA price prediction? You can trade Cardano on Coinbase—and if you&#8217;re new to the platform, you could earn up to $400 in rewards by completing a few quick educational lessons and making your first qualifying trade. Cardano (ADA), one of the most academically grounded and research-driven blockchain platforms, continues to hold a unique position in the crypto ecosystem. Launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano was built with a peer-reviewed philosophy, aiming to offer scalability, sustainability and interoperability. Unlike many other Layer-1 chains, Cardano uses a methodical and phased development approach, including formal verification to ensure the integrity of its codebase. Cardano has evolved beyond a simple cryptocurrency project. Its proof-of-stake model (Ouroboros), smart contract capabilities and focus on decentralized identity make it a key contender in the future of Web3. As its ecosystem matures with growing DeFi, NFT and real-world application deployments, investors are closely watching ADA’s long-term price potential.

As crypto markets mature, investor focus may shift toward platforms with the highest real-world use cases and active developer communities. Cardano’s roadmap includes upgrades to boost scalability, such as Hydra and Mithril. If successfully rolled out, these could offer much-needed transaction speed and efficiency improvements. Meanwhile, greater integration with regulatory-compliant frameworks might help ADA gain credibility in institutional circles. Still, regulatory uncertainty and slower dApp traction compared to competitors like Ethereum or Solana may weigh on momentum. 2030 ADA Price Prediction  This mixed outlook reflects both optimism for Cardano’s long-term vision and concerns over its pace of execution. While Cardano’s reputation for stability and security may appeal to governments and enterprises, its delayed delivery timelines could limit growth compared to more agile competitors. If Cardano achieves its full potential, becoming a scalable, regulatory-friendly blockchain for identity, payments and enterprise use, demand for ADA could rise dramatically. Global economic digitization, particularly in emerging markets, might drive use cases that validate Cardano’s original mission. Reasons to Invest in Cardano (ADA) Cardano distinguishes itself through its scientific approach, formal peer reviews and strong emphasis on security and sustainability. Its energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus model makes it an environmentally conscious alternative to older proof-of-work chains. With a maximum supply cap of 45 billion ADA, Cardano offers scarcity that can support long-term value. The platform&#8217;s commitment to real-world applications, such as identity systems in Ethiopia, supply chain tracking and academic credentialing, positions it uniquely in the market. As Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem grows and interoperability features roll out, ADA’s value proposition as a utility token could strengthen significantly. Factors That Could Slow Cardano’s Growth Despite its vision, Cardano faces challenges. One of the most cited concerns is slow development. While its phased release strategy prioritizes security, it has often lagged behind competitors in launching critical features. This delay has contributed to fewer active dApps and developer migration to faster-moving ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana. Moreover, lack of widespread DeFi adoption and limited NFT traction could dampen ADA demand. If Cardano fails to foster a vibrant developer ecosystem or attract significant user activity, its long-term price growth may be limited. Regulatory pressure or tighter global monetary conditions could also constrain investor appetite for altcoins like ADA. Price Prediction Methodology We used Benzinga’s structured crypto forecast framework to project ADA’s future prices. This includes: Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We compiled data from trusted crypto analysts and platforms like Wallet Investor, CoinCodex, Changelly and CoinPedia to form a range of low, average and high price predictions. Outlier forecasts were assessed for credibility and adjusted to maintain data accuracy. Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis Cardano’s use cases in identity, education and governance are gaining attention, especially in developing economies. As the network matures and dApp deployment increases, it could attract both institutional and retail users looking for alternatives to Ethereum. These price levels are critical to monitor for breakout confirmations or reversals through 2025–2026. Macroeconomic Factors Like other digital assets, ADA is influenced by global economic conditions. Interest rate policy, regulatory changes and liquidity flows all play a role in investor sentiment. As central banks shift toward easing or exploring CBDCs, decentralized platforms like Cardano may gain renewed attention for offering alternatives to centralized systems.

Feeling confident about this ADA price prediction? You can trade Cardano on Coinbase—and if you&#8217;re new to the platform, you could earn up to $400 in rewards by completing a few quick educational lessons and making your first qualifying trade. Cardano (ADA), one of the most academically grounded and research-driven blockchain platforms, continues to hold a unique position in the crypto ecosystem. Launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano was built with a peer-reviewed philosophy, aiming to offer scalability, sustainability and interoperability. Unlike many other Layer-1 chains, Cardano uses a methodical and phased development approach, including formal verification to ensure the integrity of its codebase. Cardano has evolved beyond a simple cryptocurrency project. Its proof-of-stake model (Ouroboros), smart contract capabilities and focus on decentralized identity make it a key contender in the future of Web3. As its ecosystem matures with growing DeFi, NFT and real-world application deployments, investors are closely watching ADA’s long-term price potential.        Table of contents [Show]     2025 ADA Price Prediction   2026 ADA Price Prediction   2030 ADA Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Cardano (ADA)   Factors That Could Slow Cardano&#8217;s Growth   Price Prediction Methodology   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions    2025 ADA Price Prediction  Bullish estimates reflect growing optimism surrounding Cardano’s expanding DeFi ecosystem and successful onboarding of projects via the Plutus smart contract platform. Institutional and retail investor sentiment could rise as Cardano strengthens its identity as a sustainable and secure blockchain. Partnerships in Africa and initiatives around decentralized identity (DID) solutions could drive adoption in underbanked regions. For these catalysts to lift ADA closer to its maximum projection, network throughput and interoperability must continue to improve. 2026 ADA Price Prediction  In 2026, ADA’s price may moderate. This move could follow a period of overextension or reflect macroeconomic headwinds. As crypto markets mature, investor focus may shift toward platforms with the highest real-world use cases and active developer communities. Cardano’s roadmap includes upgrades to boost scalability, such as Hydra and Mithril. If successfully rolled out, these could offer much-needed transaction speed and efficiency improvements. Meanwhile, greater integration with regulatory-compliant frameworks might help ADA gain credibility in institutional circles. Still, regulatory uncertainty and slower dApp traction compared to competitors like Ethereum or Solana may weigh on momentum. 2030 ADA Price Prediction  This mixed outlook reflects both optimism for Cardano’s long-term vision and concerns over its pace of execution.

A young man sits on a red couch in the lobby of Jakarta’s Marriott hotel, having just walked from his cheap digs round the corner. He’s hot and jaded after a night drinking Bir Bintang. Beige chinos and a blue cotton shirt that sticks to his back are the livery of an eager western journalist in the tropics. A waitress pushes a trolley past wearing a white uniform, starched, like a nurse’s. He orders a glass of water and a coffee. Milk, no sugar. Muzak burbles from somewhere unknown. Simply Red or Michael Bublé? He doesn’t care; he’s more into techno. His mind is already drifting back to the impressionist blur of the bar at Tanamur and the taxi ride home. He’s here to interview a renowned Professor of economics from Princeton University, who’s flown in a day late after getting the time zone wrong. The young man rereads the half dozen questions he’s scribbled in blue ink on an A4 sheet. The list seems banal and makes him sound stupid. His interviewee might sneer. Will an American academic have any idea how fast the region’s economies will grow this year, the first of the new millennium? Surely he’ll pierce through the young reporter’s feigned insight. Most of the questions are cribbed from the web. Are the World Bank and International Monetary Fund bad? Will East Asia’s lingering debts slow progress? The young man had arrived in the region a couple of years earlier, when burning Sumatra blew smoke across the Straits of Malacca. A brown veil covered the window of his forty-second-floor office. Outside, his lungs hurt. Locals wore masks decades before they caught on in the rest of the world.&nbsp; The haze, as locals called it, was caused by Indonesian farmers slashing and torching forests to plant new crops. It enveloped whole countries, seeming to mark the end of the economic boom, a time when countries leapt from the shadows. Sometimes the haze clouded the young man’s mind. He fidgets. He’s read the Prof’s best-seller (only later realising it was a play on the title of an 80s novel and film) and tried in vain to understand some of his academic papers. A decade earlier the Prof had won a big medal for up-and-coming economists – often a pointer to the Nobel. Like most liberals of the time, the young man hoovers up the Prof’s blogs and journalism. As the young man shifts again in his chair an average-sized bearded man with curly dark brown hair ambles across the hotel lobby. He wears an open-necked checked shirt and a blazer. He smiles modestly. The timid inquisitor shakes the hand of his jetlagged respondent. Pleased to meet you-hope you had a good trip-apologies for lateness-never mind (the young man was secretly glad he could spend another evening in the bar). “Do you think Malaysia’s capital controls were a good idea,” he blurts. The Prof makes a sound like a surfacing whale. “Oh, not that old line again.” “If you ask me, it was too late.” The Prof patiently explains what capital controls are: a ban on foreigners trading Malaysia’s currency and limits or levies on how much they can bring in and out of the country. He says tax might sound like a good way for Malaysia to stop investors from fleeing, but the worst has already passed and the rest of the region’s economies are beginning to grow again. The IMF and the World Bank hate the capital controls, he continues, because they violate the free-market rulebook. For that reason, lefties love them. “Will capital controls scare away foreigners in the future?” “Probably not, because everyone’s so desperate to make money.” “How do you see Asia’s – and the world’s – economic prospects now that the crisis has passed?” The Prof again exhales. He says that one of the main things about the world economy in the last few decades is that the United States buys much more from abroad than it sells &#8211; $400 billion more in 1999, to be precise. Other nations make the trinkets that rapacious US consumers crave. American manufacturing has long been dying, so more goods flow into the States than out. “More and more of our imports come from overseas,” President George Bush said that year with a straight face. You’d expect this deficit in trade to kill demand for the US dollar, continues the Prof, but the currency stays strong because the world – and particularly newly rich Asian business owners – invest their profits in American housing and shares. “In accounting terms… Oof, if ever there was a phrase designed to test the attention of a sleepy interviewer. The young man’s bum suddenly hurts and he shuffles in his seat. “… by definition if a country spends more than it earns from trade, it has to borrow or attract investment from abroad to make up the difference. The numbers are roughly equal but opposite—one’s a deficit, the other’s a surplus. The US capital account surplus, or excess of savings, is the inverse of the current account deficit.” How this plays out in practice, continues the Prof, is that the dollar and the explosion in American financial markets feed on Asia’s rise. Huge, booming nations like China and Indonesia offer oceans of cheap labour and resources. Asia’s upturn, based on cheap wages, act as the flipside of the US trade deficit and strong dollar. Plus, Washington mints the world’s currency so everyone has to use it. “Who knows how long this’ll all last? As long as it does, the world’s probably going to be OK,” says the Prof. “But the dollar’s strength despite the trade deficit is like when the cartoon character Wiley Coyote runs off a cliff into thin air. Sooner or later he looks down and plummets to the ground.”   Later, digesting the Prof’s lesson, the young man takes a taxi to Kota port in the north of the city. The pointed prows of a hundred wooden pinisi sailing ships adorn the quay. &nbsp;From a distance they look like they’re for the tourists. As he nears, he finds out that the vessels travel onwards to Sumatra carrying wood from Borneo. Painted white with a red stripe, they sport ketch rigs with ratlines running up their masts. Planks down to the quay bear sweating, barefooted men wearing sarongs, each of whom heave six hardwood beams ashore.  Pinisi ships dock at the Sunda Kelapa Harbor, Jakarta. Danumurthi Mahendra, June 28, 2008. Creative Commons Attribution 2.0. The young man wishes he had a better camera to capture the people; and to photo the ships, which look they’re from a Conrad novel. During half an hour at the far end of the dock he watches a dispute between three hulking, barefoot local Indonesians plastered in dust, and an Indonesian Chinese man in a smooth suit who then barks instructions down a mobile phone. The wild, angry stevedores stare down from the truck they just loaded. The slim, immaculate boss refuses to look them in the eye, and chatters. Many locals blame the economic malaise on the ethnic Chinese, who own a lot of businesses but mostly don’t do the hard graft. Tales circulated of businessmen selling their Mercedes for a few grand at Soekarno-Hatta airport as they fled ethnic unrest. But it wasn’t about race. The crisis was the result of hubris and the insatiable appetite of global investors for high returns. It was a regional bubble stoked by hot money flowing in from abroad and suddenly out again, fuelled by America’s thirst for stuff and blossoming Asia’s happiness to oblige – cheaply. Those stevedores are like hundreds of millions of low-waged workers across the region who power the boom. Their bosses plough the profits into the booming US stock and property markets, propping up the dollar, whose strength boosts American buying power. The United States and Asia are the pincers of a huge crab encircling the globe.   The young man walks on toward Jakarta’s LapanganMerdeka, or independence square. Towering within is the Monas monument, known locally as Sukarno’s last erection, after the first president who was kicked out in 1967. More and more green-uniformed policemen in riot gear carrying four-foot yellow batons. A training exercise, he wonders, in readiness for more demonstrations against the regime? As he draws closer to Jalan Thamrin he comes across students chanting “save Aceh” in English. The students, numbering around 200 and from Jakarta’s Muhammadiyah University, wear headbands bearing the slogan “Aksi Peduli Aceh,” or Aceh Solidarity Action. A police battalion skulks awkwardly at a distance, flowers adorning guns. Gudung Garam cigarettes lace the air with cloves. A powerful woman wearing a green tudong bellows slogans down a megaphone in front of the sitting demonstrators. She punches the air with her fist, inviting the others to follow. The young man thinks his protests against student grant cuts in London were trivial. Someone gives him an orchid, and a badge with a black ribbon which he ties to his rucksack. He chats with one of the organisers, Irwan, who tells him that the demonstrators are protesting against army oppression in Aceh, the northernmost Sumatran province long ruled by Java but with a long and fierce history of independence. Irwan says he disagrees with a new proposal that the army should automatically have seats in parliament. “The army chief should step down,” he says. The police say the protest must end at 4 o’clock. Irwan says they will leave to avoid a confrontation. He doesn’t blame the cops. What’s important is “the system”. He says that what matters is improving democracy and helping workers. Students like him are the product of Asia’s prosperity. Their education and new freedoms prompt them to question the old regime. It’s only a couple of years since the overthrow of dictator Suharto, and a nation is being rebuilt. Irwan and his friends will again grace independence square.  Monumen Nasional, Jakarta, Indonesia, Ramayoni February 10, 2019, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 A year later the young man retired his blue cotton shirt and beige chinos, returning to university to study more economics. He’d been too shy to hunt down big scoops, and his editors didn’t want him to peer through the haze. They were only interested in what was good for American business. In Singapore, he wasn’t allowed to touch politics in case the censorious regime kicked his magazine out of the country. The story was all about the city-state’s prowess in science, a sparkling new trade deal and how the buses ran on time: Singapore-lah. An article he wrote about Aceh had to be about how activists used the Internet rather than why people wanted to break with Jakarta after decades of violent oppression. And anyway in the end it was the sea, not politics, that killed the dream of independence. The Indian ocean Tsunami in 2004 swallowed up some of the Acehnese campaigners he interviewed in the province, along with nearly a quarter of a million other people. The Prof won his Nobel prize. A quarter of a century later he quit his newspaper column so that he could rail more freely against US president Donald Trump on his blogs. He’d become a kind of thought-haven for right-minded American liberals. He described the US president variously as a virus infecting American capitalism; a cancer that grew in the dark; and like Mao’s cultural revolution – an attack on democracy and intellectual inquiry. Wiley Coyote seemed to hang in the air, as the chasm beneath him, the US trade deficit, more than doubled to a trillion dollars. The world kept ploughing money into American shares and property, driving an explosion in wealth and inequality as the pay of US blue-collar workers stagnated while investments in housing and shares rocketed. By 2025 the richest top tenth owned nearly three-quarters of household wealth and about nine-tenths of the stock market.&nbsp; The profits from work outsourced to Asia were recycled so hard into American assets like houses, that the annual salaries of Gen-Z now bought less than a fifth of a house, compared with half for a Boomer in the 1950s. The average Gen Z blue-collar worker in the Midwest was now worse off than their grandparents. Pay lay in the gutter. Such generational decline was a first in the country’s young history. Any doubts about Asia’s economies recovering from the crisis were immediately dispelled as they started racing again, led by China. There, factories tripled their output in the next decade, outpacing all other major economies.&nbsp;When the young man lived in Asia, China made about 6% of the world’s stuff. By 2025, a third of everything was made there. Add in Asia and the share grew to more than a half. The idea that the region might sputter and fade was, in retrospect, ridiculous. Those Jakarta stevedores may not have been on the factory floor, but they were part of the often invisible, hard-working and low-paid regional working class that fuelled these emerging nations and supplied the world’s goods. The wood that built things; the people who carried the wood; the ships that transported them; the coal, oil, copper, and nickel; the factory workers on subsistence wages—they built the new millennium. They had more in common with their rustbelt brethren than they knew. The global financiers who profited from this feature, and the politicians they funded, would wheedle resources and cheap labour from wherever they could for as long as possible. Americans seemed hard-wired to consume. The US would never return to some golden age of middle-class prosperity where the international trading ledger balanced. Yet Trump campaigned on the impossible promise to eliminate the trade deficit. In all his idiocy, and without being able to articulate it, he was preying on the anger at the global system; the inequality that arose from wage stagnation and the boom in asset and house prices. In his dim, animalistic way, the president knew that this global lop-sidedness was the cause of his voters’ problems. His solution – balancing the trade account via tariffs – was blunt and stupid, and he kept changing his mind. But he and his advisors were in effect responding to the Prof’s lesson from back in the year 2000, that a country has to borrow or attract investment from abroad to make up the difference. To cut the trade deficit, Trump and co now wanted to stem the tide of investment flowing inwards. Paradoxically it was the United States, not wayward Malaysia, that now proposed controls on capital. Trump in 2025 proposed tightening investment rules, making it harder for supposed adversaries like China to invest in sensitive American sectors like tech and land. He proposed taxing foreign investors whose governments purportedly acted unfairly against the US.&nbsp;Some of Trump’s advisers even floated the idea of charging foreigners to buy US bonds. So it was paradoxically the US that ended up scrapping the free-market rulebook, not Asia. The young man came to realise later that the Prof., a savant who mixed metaphors and so hated Trump, missed the point. The cheap Asian labour and resources that fed the global boom, and the American appetite for more goods than it made, weren’t aberrations that debased the economy; they were a feature. It was how the global economy worked. There was no cliff, and no Wiley. Trump wasn’t a virus, a cancer, or Mao. He was a response to a decades-old feature of the global economy that enriched the rich and trampled the have-nots. Wishing for a return to some mythical normality wouldn’t help. Populists – Trump or otherwise – would keeping stoking the discontent and benefitting from it. The young man, not so young or eager now, occasionally thinks back to his time in Asia. He’s still into techno and occasionally goes to bars – though less often. He sometimes reluctantly labours under the label of economist, and spends too much of his time thinking, rethinking, and wondering how far the smoke will spread.  ", "title": "The burning of the old order", "content": "A true story  Burning House, Maria Uhden, 1918, US National Gallery of Art, Creative Commons Zero (CC0).  A young man sits on a red couch in the lobby of Jakarta’s Marriott hotel, having just walked from his cheap digs round the corner. He’s hot and jaded after a night drinking Bir Bintang. Beige chinos and a blue cotton shirt that sticks to his back are the livery of an eager western journalist in the tropics. A waitress pushes a trolley past wearing a white uniform, starched, like a nurse’s. He orders a glass of water and a coffee. Milk, no sugar. Muzak burbles from somewhere unknown. Simply Red or Michael Bublé? He doesn’t care; he’s more into techno. His mind is already drifting back to the impressionist blur of the bar at Tanamur and the taxi ride home. He’s here to interview a renowned Professor of economics from Princeton University, who’s flown in a day late after getting the time zone wrong. The young man rereads the half dozen questions he’s scribbled in blue ink on an A4 sheet. The list seems banal and makes him sound stupid. His interviewee might sneer. Will an American academic have any idea how fast the region’s economies will grow this year, the first of the new millennium? Surely he’ll pierce through the young reporter’s feigned insight. Most of the questions are cribbed from the web. Are the World Bank and International Monetary Fund bad? Will East Asia’s lingering debts slow progress? The young man had arrived in the region a couple of years earlier, when burning Sumatra blew smoke across the Straits of Malacca. A brown veil covered the window of his forty-second-floor office. Outside, his lungs hurt. Locals wore masks decades before they caught on in the rest of the world.&nbsp; The haze, as locals called it, was caused by Indonesian farmers slashing and torching forests to plant new crops. It enveloped whole countries, seeming to mark the end of the economic boom, a time when countries leapt from the shadows. Sometimes the haze clouded the young man’s mind. He fidgets. He’s read the Prof’s best-seller (only later realising it was a play on the title of an 80s novel and film) and tried in vain to understand some of his academic papers. A decade earlier the Prof had won a big medal for up-and-coming economists – often a pointer to the Nobel. Like most liberals of the time, the young man hoovers up the Prof’s blogs and journalism. As the young man shifts again in his chair an average-sized bearded man with curly dark brown hair ambles across the hotel lobby. He wears an open-necked checked shirt and a blazer. He smiles modestly. The timid inquisitor shakes the hand of his jetlagged respondent. Pleased to meet you-hope you had a good trip-apologies for lateness-never mind (the young man was secretly glad he could spend another evening in the bar). “Do you think Malaysia’s capital controls were a good idea,” he blurts. The Prof makes a sound like a surfacing whale. “Oh, not that old line again.” “If you ask me, it was too late.” The Prof patiently explains what capital controls are: a ban on foreigners trading Malaysia’s currency and limits or levies on how much they can bring in and out of the country. He says tax might sound like a good way for Malaysia to stop investors from fleeing, but the worst has already passed and the rest of the region’s economies are beginning to grow again. The IMF and the World Bank hate the capital controls, he continues, because they violate the free-market rulebook. For that reason, lefties love them. “Will capital controls scare away foreigners in the future?” “Probably not, because everyone’s so desperate to make money.” “How do you see Asia’s – and the world’s – economic prospects now that the crisis has passed?” The Prof again exhales. He says that one of the main things about the world economy in the last few decades is that the United States buys much more from abroad than it sells &#8211; $400 billion more in 1999, to be precise. Other nations make the trinkets that rapacious US consumers crave. American manufacturing has long been dying, so more goods flow into the States than out. “More and more of our imports come from overseas,” President George Bush said that year with a straight face. You’d expect this deficit in trade to kill demand for the US dollar, continues the Prof, but the currency stays strong because the world – and particularly newly rich Asian business owners – invest their profits in American housing and shares. “In accounting terms… Oof, if ever there was a phrase designed to test the attention of a sleepy interviewer. The young man’s bum suddenly hurts and he shuffles in his seat. “… by definition if a country spends more than it earns from trade, it has to borrow or attract investment from abroad to make up the difference. The numbers are roughly equal but opposite—one’s a deficit, the other’s a surplus. The US capital account surplus, or excess of savings, is the inverse of the current account deficit.” How this plays out in practice, continues the Prof, is that the dollar and the explosion in American financial markets feed on Asia’s rise. Huge, booming nations like China and Indonesia offer oceans of cheap labour and resources. Asia’s upturn, based on cheap wages, act as the flipside of the US trade deficit and strong dollar. Plus, Washington mints the world’s currency so everyone has to use it. “Who knows how long this’ll all last? As long as it does, the world’s probably going to be OK,” says the Prof. “But the dollar’s strength despite the trade deficit is like when the cartoon character Wiley Coyote runs off a cliff into thin air. Sooner or later he looks down and plummets to the ground.”   Later, digesting the Prof’s lesson, the young man takes a taxi to Kota port in the north of the city. The pointed prows of a hundred wooden pinisi sailing ships adorn the quay. &nbsp;From a distance they look like they’re for the tourists. As he nears, he finds out that the vessels travel onwards to Sumatra carrying wood from Borneo. Painted white with a red stripe, they sport ketch rigs with ratlines running up their masts. Planks down to the quay bear sweating, barefooted men wearing sarongs, each of whom heave six hardwood beams ashore.  Pinisi ships dock at the Sunda Kelapa Harbor, Jakarta. Danumurthi Mahendra, June 28, 2008. Creative Commons Attribution 2.0. The young man wishes he had a better camera to capture the people; and to photo the ships, which look they’re from a Conrad novel. During half an hour at the far end of the dock he watches a dispute between three hulking, barefoot local Indonesians plastered in dust, and an Indonesian Chinese man in a smooth suit who then barks instructions down a mobile phone. The wild, angry stevedores stare down from the truck they just loaded. The slim, immaculate boss refuses to look them in the eye, and chatters. Many locals blame the economic malaise on the ethnic Chinese, who own a lot of businesses but mostly don’t do the hard graft. Tales circulated of businessmen selling their Mercedes for a few grand at Soekarno-Hatta airport as they fled ethnic unrest. But it wasn’t about race. The crisis was the result of hubris and the insatiable appetite of global investors for high returns. It was a regional bubble stoked by hot money flowing in from abroad and suddenly out again, fuelled by America’s thirst for stuff and blossoming Asia’s happiness to oblige – cheaply. Those stevedores are like hundreds of millions of low-waged workers across the region who power the boom. Their bosses plough the profits into the booming US stock and property markets, propping up the dollar, whose strength boosts American buying power. The United States and Asia are the pincers of a huge crab encircling the globe.   The young man walks on toward Jakarta’s LapanganMerdeka, or independence square. Towering within is the Monas monument, known locally as Sukarno’s last erection, after the first president who was kicked out in 1967. More and more green-uniformed policemen in riot gear carrying four-foot yellow batons. A training exercise, he wonders, in readiness for more demonstrations against the regime? As he draws closer to Jalan Thamrin he comes across students chanting “save Aceh” in English. The students, numbering around 200 and from Jakarta’s Muhammadiyah University, wear headbands bearing the slogan “Aksi Peduli Aceh,” or Aceh Solidarity Action. A police battalion skulks awkwardly at a distance, flowers adorning guns. Gudung Garam cigarettes lace the air with cloves. A powerful woman wearing a green tudong bellows slogans down a megaphone in front of the sitting demonstrators. She punches the air with her fist, inviting the others to follow. The young man thinks his protests against student grant cuts in London were trivial. Someone gives him an orchid, and a badge with a black ribbon which he ties to his rucksack. He chats with one of the organisers, Irwan, who tells him that the demonstrators are protesting against army oppression in Aceh, the northernmost Sumatran province long ruled by Java but with a long and fierce history of independence. Irwan says he disagrees with a new proposal that the army should automatically have seats in parliament. “The army chief should step down,” he says. The police say the protest must end at 4 o’clock. Irwan says they will leave to avoid a confrontation. He doesn’t blame the cops. What’s important is “the system”. He says that what matters is improving democracy and helping workers. Students like him are the product of Asia’s prosperity. Their education and new freedoms prompt them to question the old regime. It’s only a couple of years since the overthrow of dictator Suharto, and a nation is being rebuilt. Irwan and his friends will again grace independence square.  Monumen Nasional, Jakarta, Indonesia, Ramayoni February 10, 2019, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 A year later the young man retired his blue cotton shirt and beige chinos, returning to university to study more economics. He’d been too shy to hunt down big scoops, and his editors didn’t want him to peer through the haze. They were only interested in what was good for American business. In Singapore, he wasn’t allowed to touch politics in case the censorious regime kicked his magazine out of the country. The story was all about the city-state’s prowess in science, a sparkling new trade deal and how the buses ran on time: Singapore-lah. An article he wrote about Aceh had to be about how activists used the Internet rather than why people wanted to break with Jakarta after decades of violent oppression. And anyway in the end it was the sea, not politics, that killed the dream of independence. The Indian ocean Tsunami in 2004 swallowed up some of the Acehnese campaigners he interviewed in the province, along with nearly a quarter of a million other people. The Prof won his Nobel prize. A quarter of a century later he quit his newspaper column so that he could rail more freely against US president Donald Trump on his blogs. He’d become a kind of thought-haven for right-minded American liberals. He described the US president variously as a virus infecting American capitalism; a cancer that grew in the dark; and like Mao’s cultural revolution – an attack on democracy and intellectual inquiry. Wiley Coyote seemed to hang in the air, as the chasm beneath him, the US trade deficit, more than doubled to a trillion dollars. The world kept ploughing money into American shares and property, driving an explosion in wealth and inequality as the pay of US blue-collar workers stagnated while investments in housing and shares rocketed.

Lesotho, where the original tariff would have been 50%, experiences the biggest reprieve, but its exporters will still face headwinds. Of the LDCs, Lesotho is the most exposed to US exports. Nearly three-quarters of its exports go to the US, amounting to 16% of its GDP. The economic damage before the high tariff would’ve been high — at an estimated tenth of GDP. Now, the the impact could amount to a couple of percentage points of GDP. This will still mean job losses or furlough, higher poverty, and further instability for a struggling economy. It’s wrong to imagine that the threat has receded. Haiti and Cambodia, too, remain exposed. Although a relatively small proportion of Haiti’s economy is reliant on US exports (about 5%), its total export basket is heavily US-dependent. Cambodia is more reliant on the US but its exports more geographically diversified (mainly toward Europe). Bangladesh’s total exports are the highest of any LDC (shown by the size of the bubble in the diagram below) but its reliance on the US is lower, at only about 2% of GDP. The following diagram shows that tariffs will continue to affect the LDCs most exposed to the US. Data source: OEC But it’s the policy unpredictability that’s the worst. Effectively the US has thrown the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) into question, ending the situation whereby African goods faced duty-free entry into the US. Renewal already looked unlikely. AGOA’s vulnerability to non-renewal was always its Achilles heel relative to the European Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, which was written into law in 2001 and remained less likely to be rescinded. AGOA’s demise means that some trade will be diverted toward Europe. Everyone knows businesses hate uncertainty — why would you expand your US-export orientated investment in Lesotho now, when Trump might change his mind next week? Few existing or potential investors anywhere, never mind in the LDCs, will see the US as a source of stability. And the effect of the tariffs on the US economy is the biggest source of uncertainty. Never mind a 10% tariff, a US — or global — recession is a much scarier proposition. Lower growth in the world’s economic engine will have the biggest effect on LDCs as all economies lose out. US consumers are already cutting back. Treasury bond yields have spiked (which forced Trump’s about-face). The dollar is in decline, further reducing US buying power. As stagflation beckons, few should look to the US for support. As in previous crises, clumsy and short-termist mismanagement by the world’s biggest economies and the global financial institutions that they control are the worst problems for the LDCs. A quarter century of crisis At least a dozen major environmental and economic crises have whacked the LDCs in the last quarter-century, often at the same time, starting with the dotcom crash in 2000. The Indian ocean Tsunami was in 2005. Then came the devastation of the global financial crisis in 2008. Cyclone Nargis the same year was the worst natural disaster in the history of Myanmar. Many other environmental or weather-related events severely affected smaller countries &#8211; like the Western Pacific’s cyclone Pam in 2015, which chopped off half of Vanuatu’s GDP in a year. The eurozone calamity from 2009-10 hit commodity and tourism demand worldwide — with a major fallout for LDCs. An earthquake struck Haiti. The drought in the Sahel followed, then the big three: Covid-19, inflation and now Trump.  Of course earthquakes and tsunamis aren’t human-made, but most of the others are, and they’re the result of mismanagement — either economic or environmental. Global heating is perhaps the ultimate act of foot-shooting. It’s generated by the rich world and it’s hitting the poorest the most. Small, poorer countries have fewer resources to cope with the impact of crises. Infrastructure is more fragile. Losing a job can mean starvation. No safety nets exist. So Trump’s tariffs aren’t only a self-inflicted wound. They’re a blow inflicted on the world’s most vulnerable.

The US tariffs unveiled on Wednesday will hit all 44 of the world’s&nbsp;least developed countries&nbsp;(LDCs), in some cases slashing economic growth and lowering employment — with a potentially serious impact on livelihoods. From 9 April, 31 of these countries will face a tariff rate of 10%, while in the remaining 13 rates range from 11% in Democratic Republic of the Congo, to 50% in Lesotho. For some countries, the shock will be severe. The affected African exporters will move from zero duties under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), to high rates. Several of these countries depend heavily on access to the US market. Other LDCs, like Bangladesh and Cambodia, will shift from special LDC concessionary levies at or near zero, to much higher rates — 37% in Bangladesh and 49% for Cambodia. This big new tax on every Cambodian or Bangladeshi T-shirt crossing the US border will dramatically increase costs and put those industries under strain. The move represents a major break from the last two decades, when LDCs were given duty-free, quota free access to many major markets, including the US, as part of a concerted international push to integrate the world’s least-advantaged nations into the global economy. These efforts met with mixed success, but now, just as these these mostly small, poor countries are struggling to recover from the catastrophe of Covid-19 and the supply-chain and inflation crisis, they’re being pushed down even further. Never mind kicking away the ladder; it’s a case of holding their heads under water. My initial calculations on the possible impacts are shown in the following figure.  Data source: OEC   Notes for nerds: The y-axis is the log of the estimated impact on GDP, in percentage terms. The x-axis is the % tariff rate faced by each LDC. The size of each bubble represents the log of total exports to the US, while the colour, from blue to red, signifies the proportion of the country’s exports going to the US. In the basic model used to make the calculations, I assume an elasticity of -0.75 for garments. Studies suggest that a 1% price increase reduces apparel demand by 0.5% to 1% (an elasticity of -0.5 to -1). So assuming a elasticity of of -0.75, half way between these levels, a 50% price increase could reduce demand in Lesotho by 37.5% (0.75 × 50%), a loss of $120 million. Garments are easily substitutable, so this seems plausible. For commodity exporters like Angola and DR Congo I assume a lower elasticity of -0.4. I also assume that the impact of reduced spending on each economy multiplies the impact by 1.5 to 2. Clearly this is a very basic model put together quickly that hasn&#8217;t been academically reviewed, and doubtless has shortcomings. But it serves as a rough guide as to which countries will be affected worst, together with the magnitudes.    Lesotho&nbsp;will suffer worst, given the dependence of the economy on exports to the US, mostly garments. Lesotho’s $2.05 billion economy sends approximately $320 million in garments to the US, or three quarters of all exports, manufactured in zones near the capital Maseru, which are run by Chinese and Taiwanese investors. About 36,000 people work in these factories, which provide much-needed employment in a country where the poverty rate tops half of all people. This is a poor and vulnerable country which desperately needs all the help it can get. For example when I last visited about a dozen years ago, average life expectancy was only 47. Now, it’s risen, but to only 53, one of the lowest levels in the world. The overall impact on Lesotho’s GDP could be as high as 10%. Of course manufacturers might switch some production elsewhere, but supply chains are most likely carefully designed to meet the exact demand of US consumers, and new markets won’t easily be found, especially when other garment exporters are facing the same situation. Instead of cutting jobs, employers might try to furlough workers or pay them less — although neither of these options would be good. It’s quite possible that investors will simply shut up shup and move elsewhere. The industry is surprisingly footloose, with relatively low capital outlays and basic skill levels. Because of the poor design of the tariffs and the fact that they’re somewhat arbitrary, some countries may just shift production to a low tariff neighbour and carry on as usual. Might an African neighbour benefit? Trump doesn’t seem to know about&nbsp;rules of origin. Either way, the impact could be disastrous. Cambodia&nbsp;is also going to get hammered unless something changes. About 35% of its exports, also mostly garments, go to the US. That’s about 8.7% of GDP. My basic calculations suggest that the impact on GDP could be as much as 5% — not as bad as Lesotho but still highly destabilising in a poor country with limited opportunity for diversification and facing fierce competition. Madagascar’s&nbsp;vanilla exporters are also likely to suffer. About a quarter of the country’s exports go to the US and it faces a 47% tariff. Laos, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Angola&nbsp;equally face a potentially severe impact. All either meet the criteria to graduate from the LDC category or are imminently scheduled to do so. The US tariffs will set back their cause. Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest garment exporter and the industry has propelled the country to high rates of economic growth in recent years, leading to poverty reduction of as much as 50 million. Against the backdrop of the country’s recent regime change, the huge garment industry needs to be supported, not undermined. Although Bangladesh didn’t benefit significantly from the US duty-free, quota-free scheme, the 20% of exports that go to the US cannot quickly switch to Europe. During my visits to Dhaka, business leaders told me they could cope with the few percentage points tariff increase that may come through LDC graduation, but presumably not 37%. It will be workers who pay, not factory owners. Over&nbsp;3000 people have died&nbsp;in&nbsp;Myanmar&nbsp;following the earthquake last Friday. However poisonous the regime, slapping the country with a 44% tariff at this time seems positively cruel. European investors told me when I went to Naypyidaw and Yangon before the 2021 coup that the country was already barely competitive in garments, and risked losing business to more stable and cheaper Asian neighbours. The same goes for&nbsp;Haiti.&nbsp;60% of its exports — again garments — go to the US. The country is reported as being essentially ungovernable, with gangs controlling large parts of the capital, Port-au-Prince and the economy in freefall. Although the US tariff is ‘only’ 10%, it’ll still have an impact on an already desperate situation, given the volumes involved, the dire need for jobs and the undiversified nature of the economy. I&nbsp;worked in Haiti&nbsp;during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and only on a few occasions have I been amidst such destruction, and seen such hopelessness. Things have got worse since then. Inflicting more pain on a country where nearly 60% live below the poverty line seems simply abusive. A devastating failure Most LDCs will escape any major impact because they don’t export much to US, total exports were minimal, or the proposed tariff is low — or some combination of the three. Several didn’t benefit much from the US duty-free scheme anyway. Some LDCs might be able to switch export to other markets. Doubtless China will swoop in to buy more from the commodity producers. The EU is already preparing to receive a flood of goods previously destined for the US market but which will now be diverted. But overall, in the eight or more counties where the tariffs will have a major impact, jobs at risk could total as many as 380,000 — mostly in Bangladesh and Cambodia, but also elsewhere. Any job in an LDC is a hard-won prize, and replacing lost employment is often much harder than in richer, more diversified countries. The loss of export revenues could reach as much as a quarter of the total from LDCs unless something changes. For Lesotho and Myanmar the potential economic impact will be severe and possibly even unmanageable. LDCs don’t have unemployment benefits and most people have no or minimal savings. And this is on top of&nbsp;US aid cuts, which are already biting hard. What’s horribly ironic is that the tariffs on these countries won’t even benefit the US, which isn’t quickly going to bring back garment production — nor should it want to. US workers won’t graft for six days a week making T-shirts for $100 a month, as Bangladeshis do. The US can’t even produce some of the things it’s supposedly ‘protecting’. Good luck growing bananas or coffee. The tariffs will mean higher costs for US businesses and consumers. And the collective trade surplus of the LDCs with the US amounts to only 0.001% of the US trade deficit, so will make absolutely no difference to Trump’s stated (stupid) aim of ‘balanced’ trade — not that tariffs will do so anyway. In sum, these half-baked and poorly-thought-out tariffs, which will raise rates to the highest in over a century, will not only fail, but will needlessly inflict yet more pain on populations that were already suffering from severe poverty and deprivation. As i’ve&nbsp;said elsewhere, the oligarchs currently mismanaging the US economy don’t care. They view ordinary people as expendable, and any unintended consequences arising from their blunders as meaningless collateral damage.
