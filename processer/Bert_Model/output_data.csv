During his presidency, Trump’s fiscal policies added $8.4 trillion to the national debt, $4.8 trillion of that not related to pandemic relief. The CBO estimates that under current policies, including recent legislation associated with Trump’s agenda, the national debt could reach $54 trillion in the next decade. https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/can-we-afford-defend-america-without-going-bankrupt https://thehill.com/business/4736740-trump-biden-fiscal-policy-deficit/",flywithfitz81,1,0,,,https://stocktwits.com/flywithfitz81/message/633934291,,DIA,,514.0

The US tariffs unveiled on Wednesday will hit all 44 of the world’s least developed countries (LDCs), in some cases slashing economic growth and lowering employment — with a potentially serious impact on livelihoods. From 9 April, 31 of these countries will face a tariff rate of 10%, while in the remaining 13 rates range from 11% in Democratic Republic of the Congo, to 50% in Lesotho. For some countries, the shock will be severe. The affected African exporters will move from zero duties under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), to high rates. Several of these countries depend heavily on access to the US market. Other LDCs, like Bangladesh and Cambodia, will shift from special LDC concessionary levies at or near zero, to much higher rates — 37% in Bangladesh and 49% for Cambodia. This big new tax on every Cambodian or Bangladeshi T-shirt crossing the US border will dramatically increase costs and put those industries under strain. The move represents a major break from the last two decades, when LDCs were given duty-free, quota free access to many major markets, including the US, as part of a concerted international push to integrate the world’s least-advantaged nations into the global economy. These efforts met with mixed success, but now, just as these these mostly small, poor countries are struggling to recover from the catastrophe of Covid-19 and the supply-chain and inflation crisis, they’re being pushed down even further. Never mind kicking away the ladder; it’s a case of holding their heads under water. My initial calculations on the possible impacts are shown in the following figure. Data source: OEC Notes for nerds: The y-axis is the log of the estimated impact on GDP, in percentage terms. The x-axis is the % tariff rate faced by each LDC. The size of each bubble represents the log of total exports to the US, while the colour, from blue to red, signifies the proportion of the country’s exports going to the US. In the basic model used to make the calculations, I assume an elasticity of -0.75 for garments. Studies suggest that a 1% price increase reduces apparel demand by 0.5% to 1% (an elasticity of -0.5 to -1). So assuming a elasticity of of -0.75, half way between these levels, a 50% price increase could reduce demand in Lesotho by 37.5% (0.75 × 50%), a loss of $120 million. Garments are easily substitutable, so this seems plausible. For commodity exporters like Angola and DR Congo I assume a lower elasticity of -0.4. I also assume that the impact of reduced spending on each economy multiplies the impact by 1.5 to 2. Clearly this is a very basic model put together quickly that hasn’t been academically reviewed, and doubtless has shortcomings. But it serves as a rough guide as to which countries will be affected worst, together with the magnitudes. Lesotho will suffer worst, given the dependence of the economy on exports to the US, mostly garments. Lesotho’s $2.05 billion economy sends approximately $320 million in garments to the US, or three quarters of all exports, manufactured in zones near the capital Maseru, which are run by Chinese and Taiwanese investors. About 36,000 people work in these factories, which provide much-needed employment in a country where the poverty rate tops half of all people. This is a poor and vulnerable country which desperately needs all the help it can get. For example when I last visited about a dozen years ago, average life expectancy was only 47. Now, it’s risen, but to only 53, one of the lowest levels in the world. The overall impact on Lesotho’s GDP could be as high as 10%. Of course manufacturers might switch some production elsewhere, but supply chains are most likely carefully designed to meet the exact demand of US consumers, and new markets won’t easily be found, especially when other garment exporters are facing the same situation. Instead of cutting jobs, employers might try to furlough workers or pay them less — although neither of these options would be good. It’s quite possible that investors will simply shut up shup and move elsewhere. The industry is surprisingly footloose, with relatively low capital outlays and basic skill levels. Because of the poor design of the tariffs and the fact that they’re somewhat arbitrary, some countries may just shift production to a low tariff neighbour and carry on as usual. Might an African neighbour benefit? Trump doesn’t seem to know about rules of origin. Either way, the impact could be disastrous. Cambodia is also going to get hammered unless something changes. About 35% of its exports, also mostly garments, go to the US. That’s about 8.7% of GDP. My basic calculations suggest that the impact on GDP could be as much as 5% — not as bad as Lesotho but still highly destabilising in a poor country with limited opportunity for diversification and facing fierce competition. Madagascar’s vanilla exporters are also likely to suffer. About a quarter of the country’s exports go to the US and it faces a 47% tariff. Laos, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Angola equally face a potentially severe impact. All either meet the criteria to graduate from the LDC category or are imminently scheduled to do so. The US tariffs will set back their cause. Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest garment exporter and the industry has propelled the country to high rates of economic growth in recent years, leading to poverty reduction of as much as 50 million. Against the backdrop of the country’s recent regime change, the huge garment industry needs to be supported, not undermined. Although Bangladesh didn’t benefit significantly from the US duty-free, quota-free scheme, the 20% of exports that go to the US cannot quickly switch to Europe. During my visits to Dhaka, business leaders told me they could cope with the few percentage points tariff increase that may come through LDC graduation, but presumably not 37%. It will be workers who pay, not factory owners. Over 3000 people have died in Myanmar following the earthquake last Friday. However poisonous the regime, slapping the country with a 44% tariff at this time seems positively cruel. European investors told me when I went to Naypyidaw and Yangon before the 2021 coup that the country was already barely competitive in garments, and risked losing business to more stable and cheaper Asian neighbours. The same goes for Haiti. 60% of its exports — again garments — go to the US. The country is reported as being essentially ungovernable, with gangs controlling large parts of the capital, Port-au-Prince and the economy in freefall. Although the US tariff is ‘only’ 10%, it’ll still have an impact on an already desperate situation, given the volumes involved, the dire need for jobs and the undiversified nature of the economy. I worked in Haiti during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and only on a few occasions have I been amidst such destruction, and seen such hopelessness. Things have got worse since then. Inflicting more pain on a country where nearly 60% live below the poverty line seems simply abusive. A devastating failure Most LDCs will escape any major impact because they don’t export much to US, total exports were minimal, or the proposed tariff is low — or some combination of the three. Several didn’t benefit much from the US duty-free scheme anyway. Some LDCs might be able to switch export to other markets. Doubtless China will swoop in to buy more from the commodity producers. The EU is already preparing to receive a flood of goods previously destined for the US market but which will now be diverted. But overall, in the eight or more counties where the tariffs will have a major impact, jobs at risk could total as many as 380,000 — mostly in Bangladesh and Cambodia, but also elsewhere. Any job in an LDC is a hard-won prize, and replacing lost employment is often much harder than in richer, more diversified countries. The loss of export revenues could reach as much as a quarter of the total from LDCs unless something changes. For Lesotho and Myanmar the potential economic impact will be severe and possibly even unmanageable. LDCs don’t have unemployment benefits and most people have no or minimal savings. And this is on top of US aid cuts, which are already biting hard. What’s horribly ironic is that the tariffs on these countries won’t even benefit the US, which isn’t quickly going to bring back garment production — nor should it want to. US workers won’t graft for six days a week making T-shirts for $100 a month, as Bangladeshis do. The US can’t even produce some of the things it’s supposedly ‘protecting’. Good luck growing bananas or coffee. The tariffs will mean higher costs for US businesses and consumers. And the collective trade surplus of the LDCs with the US amounts to only 0.001% of the US trade deficit, so will make absolutely no difference to Trump’s stated (stupid) aim of ‘balanced’ trade — not that tariffs will do so anyway. In sum, these half-baked and poorly-thought-out tariffs, which will raise rates to the highest in over a century, will not only fail, but will needlessly inflict yet more pain on populations that were already suffering from severe poverty and deprivation. As i’ve said elsewhere, the oligarchs currently mismanaging the US economy don’t care. They view ordinary people as expendable, and any unintended consequences arising from their blunders as meaningless collateral damage.

Lesotho, where the original tariff would have been 50%, experiences the biggest reprieve, but its exporters will still face headwinds. Of the LDCs, Lesotho is the most exposed to US exports. Nearly three-quarters of its exports go to the US, amounting to 16% of its GDP. The economic damage before the high tariff would’ve been high — at an estimated tenth of GDP. Now, the the impact could amount to a couple of percentage points of GDP. This will still mean job losses or furlough, higher poverty, and further instability for a struggling economy. It’s wrong to imagine that the threat has receded. Haiti and Cambodia, too, remain exposed. Although a relatively small proportion of Haiti’s economy is reliant on US exports (about 5%), its total export basket is heavily US-dependent. Cambodia is more reliant on the US but its exports more geographically diversified (mainly toward Europe). Bangladesh’s total exports are the highest of any LDC (shown by the size of the bubble in the diagram below) but its reliance on the US is lower, at only about 2% of GDP. The following diagram shows that tariffs will continue to affect the LDCs most exposed to the US. Data source: OEC But it’s the policy unpredictability that’s the worst. Effectively the US has thrown the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) into question, ending the situation whereby African goods faced duty-free entry into the US. Renewal already looked unlikely. AGOA’s vulnerability to non-renewal was always its Achilles heel relative to the European Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, which was written into law in 2001 and remained less likely to be rescinded. AGOA’s demise means that some trade will be diverted toward Europe. Everyone knows businesses hate uncertainty — why would you expand your US-export orientated investment in Lesotho now, when Trump might change his mind next week? Few existing or potential investors anywhere, never mind in the LDCs, will see the US as a source of stability. And the effect of the tariffs on the US economy is the biggest source of uncertainty. Never mind a 10% tariff, a US — or global — recession is a much scarier proposition. Lower growth in the world’s economic engine will have the biggest effect on LDCs as all economies lose out. US consumers are already cutting back. Treasury bond yields have spiked (which forced Trump’s about-face). The dollar is in decline, further reducing US buying power. As stagflation beckons, few should look to the US for support. As in previous crises, clumsy and short-termist mismanagement by the world’s biggest economies and the global financial institutions that they control are the worst problems for the LDCs. A quarter century of crisis At least a dozen major environmental and economic crises have whacked the LDCs in the last quarter-century, often at the same time, starting with the dotcom crash in 2000. The Indian ocean Tsunami was in 2005. Then came the devastation of the global financial crisis in 2008. Cyclone Nargis the same year was the worst natural disaster in the history of Myanmar. Many other environmental or weather-related events severely affected smaller countries – like the Western Pacific’s cyclone Pam in 2015, which chopped off half of Vanuatu’s GDP in a year. The eurozone calamity from 2009-10 hit commodity and tourism demand worldwide — with a major fallout for LDCs. An earthquake struck Haiti. The drought in the Sahel followed, then the big three: Covid-19, inflation and now Trump. Of course earthquakes and tsunamis aren’t human-made, but most of the others are, and they’re the result of mismanagement — either economic or environmental. Global heating is perhaps the ultimate act of foot-shooting. It’s generated by the rich world and it’s hitting the poorest the most. Small, poorer countries have fewer resources to cope with the impact of crises. Infrastructure is more fragile. Losing a job can mean starvation. No safety nets exist. So Trump’s tariffs aren’t only a self-inflicted wound. They’re a blow inflicted on the world’s most vulnerable. And just as many of the crises of the past quarter century could have been avoided or ameliorated, this latest bout of policy stupidity wasn’t inevitable. I’ve long thought that we don’t need to get too clever in our theories about how to improve the relationship between the rich and poor countries (or core and periphery, developed and developing, or North and South — whichever couplet the theory demands). No, one of the first and most achievable things would be for the rich world to stop doing supposedly self-interested but ill-considered things which have a disproportionate impact on the world’s poorest. Part of the fate of the LDCs is in the hands of rich-world policymakers. Stop doing stupid things.

A young man sits on a red couch in the lobby of Jakarta’s Marriott hotel, having just walked from his cheap digs round the corner. He’s hot and jaded after a night drinking Bir Bintang. Beige chinos and a blue cotton shirt that sticks to his back are the livery of an eager western journalist in the tropics. A waitress pushes a trolley past wearing a white uniform, starched, like a nurse’s. He orders a glass of water and a coffee. Milk, no sugar. Muzak burbles from somewhere unknown. Simply Red or Michael Bublé? He doesn’t care; he’s more into techno. His mind is already drifting back to the impressionist blur of the bar at Tanamur and the taxi ride home. He’s here to interview a renowned Professor of economics from Princeton University, who’s flown in a day late after getting the time zone wrong. The young man rereads the half dozen questions he’s scribbled in blue ink on an A4 sheet. The list seems banal and makes him sound stupid. His interviewee might sneer. Will an American academic have any idea how fast the region’s economies will grow this year, the first of the new millennium? Surely he’ll pierce through the young reporter’s feigned insight. Most of the questions are cribbed from the web. Are the World Bank and International Monetary Fund bad? Will East Asia’s lingering debts slow progress? The young man had arrived in the region a couple of years earlier, when burning Sumatra blew smoke across the Straits of Malacca. A brown veil covered the window of his forty-second-floor office. Outside, his lungs hurt. Locals wore masks decades before they caught on in the rest of the world. The haze, as locals called it, was caused by Indonesian farmers slashing and torching forests to plant new crops. It enveloped whole countries, seeming to mark the end of the economic boom, a time when countries leapt from the shadows. Sometimes the haze clouded the young man’s mind. He fidgets. He’s read the Prof’s best-seller (only later realising it was a play on the title of an 80s novel and film) and tried in vain to understand some of his academic papers. A decade earlier the Prof had won a big medal for up-and-coming economists – often a pointer to the Nobel. Like most liberals of the time, the young man hoovers up the Prof’s blogs and journalism. As the young man shifts again in his chair an average-sized bearded man with curly dark brown hair ambles across the hotel lobby. He wears an open-necked checked shirt and a blazer. He smiles modestly. The timid inquisitor shakes the hand of his jetlagged respondent. Pleased to meet you-hope you had a good trip-apologies for lateness-never mind (the young man was secretly glad he could spend another evening in the bar). “Do you think Malaysia’s capital controls were a good idea,” he blurts. The Prof makes a sound like a surfacing whale. “Oh, not that old line again.” “If you ask me, it was too late.” The Prof patiently explains what capital controls are: a ban on foreigners trading Malaysia’s currency and limits or levies on how much they can bring in and out of the country. He says tax might sound like a good way for Malaysia to stop investors from fleeing, but the worst has already passed and the rest of the region’s economies are beginning to grow again. The IMF and the World Bank hate the capital controls, he continues, because they violate the free-market rulebook. For that reason, lefties love them. “Will capital controls scare away foreigners in the future?” “Probably not, because everyone’s so desperate to make money.” “How do you see Asia’s – and the world’s – economic prospects now that the crisis has passed?” The Prof again exhales. He says that one of the main things about the world economy in the last few decades is that the United States buys much more from abroad than it sells – $400 billion more in 1999, to be precise. Other nations make the trinkets that rapacious US consumers crave. American manufacturing has long been dying, so more goods flow into the States than out. “More and more of our imports come from overseas,” President George Bush said that year with a straight face. You’d expect this deficit in trade to kill demand for the US dollar, continues the Prof, but the currency stays strong because the world – and particularly newly rich Asian business owners – invest their profits in American housing and shares. “In accounting terms… Oof, if ever there was a phrase designed to test the attention of a sleepy interviewer. The young man’s bum suddenly hurts and he shuffles in his seat. “… by definition if a country spends more than it earns from trade, it has to borrow or attract investment from abroad to make up the difference. The numbers are roughly equal but opposite—one’s a deficit, the other’s a surplus. The US capital account surplus, or excess of savings, is the inverse of the current account deficit.” How this plays out in practice, continues the Prof, is that the dollar and the explosion in American financial markets feed on Asia’s rise. Huge, booming nations like China and Indonesia offer oceans of cheap labour and resources. Asia’s upturn, based on cheap wages, act as the flipside of the US trade deficit and strong dollar. Plus, Washington mints the world’s currency so everyone has to use it. “Who knows how long this’ll all last? As long as it does, the world’s probably going to be OK,” says the Prof. “But the dollar’s strength despite the trade deficit is like when the cartoon character Wiley Coyote runs off a cliff into thin air. Sooner or later he looks down and plummets to the ground.” Later, digesting the Prof’s lesson, the young man takes a taxi to Kota port in the north of the city. The pointed prows of a hundred wooden pinisi sailing ships adorn the quay. From a distance they look like they’re for the tourists. As he nears, he finds out that the vessels travel onwards to Sumatra carrying wood from Borneo. Painted white with a red stripe, they sport ketch rigs with ratlines running up their masts. Planks down to the quay bear sweating, barefooted men wearing sarongs, each of whom heave six hardwood beams ashore. Pinisi ships dock at the Sunda Kelapa Harbor, Jakarta. Danumurthi Mahendra, June 28, 2008. Creative Commons Attribution 2.0. The young man wishes he had a better camera to capture the people; and to photo the ships, which look they’re from a Conrad novel. During half an hour at the far end of the dock he watches a dispute between three hulking, barefoot local Indonesians plastered in dust, and an Indonesian Chinese man in a smooth suit who then barks instructions down a mobile phone. The wild, angry stevedores stare down from the truck they just loaded. The slim, immaculate boss refuses to look them in the eye, and chatters. Many locals blame the economic malaise on the ethnic Chinese, who own a lot of businesses but mostly don’t do the hard graft. Tales circulated of businessmen selling their Mercedes for a few grand at Soekarno-Hatta airport as they fled ethnic unrest. But it wasn’t about race. The crisis was the result of hubris and the insatiable appetite of global investors for high returns. It was a regional bubble stoked by hot money flowing in from abroad and suddenly out again, fuelled by America’s thirst for stuff and blossoming Asia’s happiness to oblige – cheaply. Those stevedores are like hundreds of millions of low-waged workers across the region who power the boom. Their bosses plough the profits into the booming US stock and property markets, propping up the dollar, whose strength boosts American buying power. The United States and Asia are the pincers of a huge crab encircling the globe. The young man walks on toward Jakarta’s LapanganMerdeka, or independence square. Towering within is the Monas monument, known locally as Sukarno’s last erection, after the first president who was kicked out in 1967. More and more green-uniformed policemen in riot gear carrying four-foot yellow batons. A training exercise, he wonders, in readiness for more demonstrations against the regime? As he draws closer to Jalan Thamrin he comes across students chanting “save Aceh” in English. The students, numbering around 200 and from Jakarta’s Muhammadiyah University, wear headbands bearing the slogan “Aksi Peduli Aceh,” or Aceh Solidarity Action. A police battalion skulks awkwardly at a distance, flowers adorning guns. Gudung Garam cigarettes lace the air with cloves. A powerful woman wearing a green tudong bellows slogans down a megaphone in front of the sitting demonstrators. She punches the air with her fist, inviting the others to follow. The young man thinks his protests against student grant cuts in London were trivial. Someone gives him an orchid, and a badge with a black ribbon which he ties to his rucksack. He chats with one of the organisers, Irwan, who tells him that the demonstrators are protesting against army oppression in Aceh, the northernmost Sumatran province long ruled by Java but with a long and fierce history of independence. Irwan says he disagrees with a new proposal that the army should automatically have seats in parliament. “The army chief should step down,” he says. The police say the protest must end at 4 o’clock. Irwan says they will leave to avoid a confrontation. He doesn’t blame the cops. What’s important is “the system”. He says that what matters is improving democracy and helping workers. Students like him are the product of Asia’s prosperity. Their education and new freedoms prompt them to question the old regime. It’s only a couple of years since the overthrow of dictator Suharto, and a nation is being rebuilt. Irwan and his friends will again grace independence square. Monumen Nasional, Jakarta, Indonesia, Ramayoni February 10, 2019, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 A year later the young man retired his blue cotton shirt and beige chinos, returning to university to study more economics. He’d been too shy to hunt down big scoops, and his editors didn’t want him to peer through the haze. They were only interested in what was good for American business. In Singapore, he wasn’t allowed to touch politics in case the censorious regime kicked his magazine out of the country. The story was all about the city-state’s prowess in science, a sparkling new trade deal and how the buses ran on time: Singapore-lah. An article he wrote about Aceh had to be about how activists used the Internet rather than why people wanted to break with Jakarta after decades of violent oppression. And anyway in the end it was the sea, not politics, that killed the dream of independence. The Indian ocean Tsunami in 2004 swallowed up some of the Acehnese campaigners he interviewed in the province, along with nearly a quarter of a million other people. The Prof won his Nobel prize. A quarter of a century later he quit his newspaper column so that he could rail more freely against US president Donald Trump on his blogs. He’d become a kind of thought-haven for right-minded American liberals. He described the US president variously as a virus infecting American capitalism; a cancer that grew in the dark; and like Mao’s cultural revolution – an attack on democracy and intellectual inquiry. Wiley Coyote seemed to hang in the air, as the chasm beneath him, the US trade deficit, more than doubled to a trillion dollars. The world kept ploughing money into American shares and property, driving an explosion in wealth and inequality as the pay of US blue-collar workers stagnated while investments in housing and shares rocketed. By 2025 the richest top tenth owned nearly three-quarters of household wealth and about nine-tenths of the stock market. The profits from work outsourced to Asia were recycled so hard into American assets like houses, that the annual salaries of Gen-Z now bought less than a fifth of a house, compared with half for a Boomer in the 1950s. The average Gen Z blue-collar worker in the Midwest was now worse off than their grandparents. Pay lay in the gutter. Such generational decline was a first in the country’s young history. Any doubts about Asia’s economies recovering from the crisis were immediately dispelled as they started racing again, led by China. There, factories tripled their output in the next decade, outpacing all other major economies. When the young man lived in Asia, China made about 6% of the world’s stuff. By 2025, a third of everything was made there. Add in Asia and the share grew to more than a half. The idea that the region might sputter and fade was, in retrospect, ridiculous. Those Jakarta stevedores may not have been on the factory floor, but they were part of the often invisible, hard-working and low-paid regional working class that fuelled these emerging nations and supplied the world’s goods. The wood that built things; the people who carried the wood; the ships that transported them; the coal, oil, copper, and nickel; the factory workers on subsistence wages—they built the new millennium. They had more in common with their rustbelt brethren than they knew. The global financiers who profited from this feature, and the politicians they funded, would wheedle resources and cheap labour from wherever they could for as long as possible. Americans seemed hard-wired to consume. The US would never return to some golden age of middle-class prosperity where the international trading ledger balanced. Yet Trump campaigned on the impossible promise to eliminate the trade deficit. In all his idiocy, and without being able to articulate it, he was preying on the anger at the global system; the inequality that arose from wage stagnation and the boom in asset and house prices. In his dim, animalistic way, the president knew that this global lop-sidedness was the cause of his voters’ problems. His solution – balancing the trade account via tariffs – was blunt and stupid, and he kept changing his mind. But he and his advisors were in effect responding to the Prof’s lesson from back in the year 2000, that a country has to borrow or attract investment from abroad to make up the difference. To cut the trade deficit, Trump and co now wanted to stem the tide of investment flowing inwards. Paradoxically it was the United States, not wayward Malaysia, that now proposed controls on capital. Trump in 2025 proposed tightening investment rules, making it harder for supposed adversaries like China to invest in sensitive American sectors like tech and land. He proposed taxing foreign investors whose governments purportedly acted unfairly against the US. Some of Trump’s advisers even floated the idea of charging foreigners to buy US bonds. So it was paradoxically the US that ended up scrapping the free-market rulebook, not Asia. The young man came to realise later that the Prof., a savant who mixed metaphors and so hated Trump, missed the point. The cheap Asian labour and resources that fed the global boom, and the American appetite for more goods than it made, weren’t aberrations that debased the economy; they were a feature. It was how the global economy worked. There was no cliff, and no Wiley. Trump wasn’t a virus, a cancer, or Mao. He was a response to a decades-old feature of the global economy that enriched the rich and trampled the have-nots. Wishing for a return to some mythical normality wouldn’t help. Populists – Trump or otherwise – would keeping stoking the discontent and benefitting from it. The young man, not so young or eager now, occasionally thinks back to his time in Asia. He’s still into techno and occasionally goes to bars – though less often. He sometimes reluctantly labours under the label of economist, and spends too much of his time thinking, rethinking, and wondering how far the smoke will spread.",Dan,0,0,,"asia, china, development, donald-trump, economics, economy, politics, trade, trump, uncategorized, us",https://emergenteconomics.com/2025/07/10/the-burning-of-the-old-order/,,,,

This post Swiss Bitcoin-Only App Relai Secures MiCA License in France first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Micah Zimmerman. Bitcoin Magazine Swiss Bitcoin-Only App Relai Secures MiCA License in France Swiss Bitcoin app Relai has become one of the first Bitcoin-only companies to receive regulatory approval under Europe’s landmark Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) framework. The Zurich-based firm announced today that it has been granted authorization as a Crypto-Asset Service Provider (CASP) by France’s Financial Markets Authority (AMF), according to a note shared with Bitcoin Magazine. The approval marks a significant moment not just for Relai, but for the broader Bitcoin ecosystem in Europe. The MiCA regulation, which came into effect earlier this year, establishes uniform rules for crypto companies across the EU, aiming to increase investor protection and reduce regulatory fragmentation between member states. While large exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are still navigating the complex licensing process, Relai’s early authorization gives it a head start as one of the first Bitcoin-only firms to achieve compliance. “We’re incredibly proud to be one of the first Bitcoin companies to get the MiCA license and are eager to expand to France first — and Europe in a second step,” said Julian Liniger, co-founder and CEO of Relai. “This is a big moment for Bitcoin adoption on the continent.” Relai is expanding a bitcoin-only vision across Europe Founded in Zurich in 2020, Relai has grown despite a rough regulatory environment for digital assets. The company closed a Series A funding round last year and surpassed 500,000 app downloads, establishing itself as a user-friendly gateway for European retail investors seeking exposure to Bitcoin without intermediaries. With the MiCA license secured, Relai can now “passport” its services across the EU — meaning it can operate in all 27 member states once formal notification procedures are complete. The company plans to introduce a suite of new features tailored to European users, including Instant SEPA payments, higher trading limits, fixed-price transparency, and enhanced security standards. Relai also intends to invest in education and community-building, launching localized learning resources and sponsoring Bitcoin events across Europe. “Our goal is clear: bringing Bitcoin to as many people as possible — simple, secure, and regulated,” said Adem Bilican, co-founder and president of Relai EU. The company is also strengthening its governance with a newly appointed advisory board, featuring industry veterans Jean Guillaume, Daniel Astraud, and Herve de Kerdrel, who will provide guidance on regulatory compliance and strategic growth. Relai plans to leverage its MiCA approval to expand across Europe, with marketing campaigns and app updates scheduled for 2026.

This post Trump Picks SEC Crypto Counsel Michael Selig to Lead CFTC first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Micah Zimmerman. Bitcoin Magazine Trump Picks SEC Crypto Counsel Michael Selig to Lead CFTC President Donald Trump has selected Michael Selig, chief counsel for the Securities and Exchange Commission’s crypto task force, to chair the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). Selig’s nomination, first reported by Bloomberg, marks Trump’s second attempt to fill the CFTC’s top post, following the stalled nomination of Brian Quintenz, a16z crypto’s global policy chief, amid opposition from Gemini co-founder Tyler Winklevoss. Selig, who serves as an aide to SEC Chairman Paul Atkins, has been instrumental in coordinating regulatory approaches between the SEC and CFTC on financial and crypto market oversight. The CFTC, which regulates futures, swaps, and prediction markets, is gaining greater prominence as Congress considers new crypto market structure legislation. Before joining the SEC, he was a partner at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, specializing in asset management. Selig’s appointment will require Senate confirmation. JUST IN: President Trump selects Michael Selig as CFTC chair amid crypto growth. pic.twitter.com/VeFZITp8U6— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 24, 2025 President Trump’s growing support for crypto President Donald Trump also recently granted a full pardon to Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, calling his prosecution part of the prior administration’s “war on cryptocurrency.” The move, confirmed by the White House, clears Zhao’s record and echoes a major shift in the government’s approach to the crypto industry. Selig’s appointment comes as momentum behind U.S. crypto legislation accelerated this week as Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said the industry was “90%” of the way toward securing passage of the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, or CLARITY Act. Despite a partial government shutdown, lawmakers from both parties reportedly made major progress on the long-awaited market structure bill. Armstrong met with senators from both parties, including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, Cynthia Lummis, and Tim Scott, describing the discussions as “very productive.” The bill, which passed the House in July with a bipartisan 294–137 vote, aimed to clarify which digital assets fall under the SEC versus the CFTC, while providing rules for decentralized finance (DeFi), stablecoins, and custody services. The final sticking points centered on how to regulate DeFi and whether consumers could earn rewards on stablecoins. Crypto advocates urged lawmakers to target regulation at intermediaries rather than open-source code and warned that the banking lobby sought to limit yield on stablecoin holdings. Despite procedural delays from the shutdown, optimism remained high. Lummis said she expected the bill to reach President Trump’s desk before year-end, calling it the most significant bipartisan step toward U.S. crypto clarity to date.

The business intelligence firm acquired 390 BTC between October 20 and October 26, spending approximately $43.4 million at an average price of $111,053 per Bitcoin. According to a Form 8-K filing released today, Strategy’s total Bitcoin holdings have now reached 640,808 BTC, with an aggregate purchase price of $47.44 billion. The company’s average purchase price stands at $74,032 per Bitcoin, including fees and expenses. The latest acquisition was funded through proceeds from Strategy’s At-The-Market (ATM) equity programs, specifically through the issuance of preferred shares under its STRF, STRK, and STRD ATM programs. The company raised a combined total of $43.4 million during the period to finance these purchases. The announcement comes amid a growing trend of companies adopting Bitcoin treasury strategies. Recent data indicates that publicly traded companies now hold over $110 billion worth of Bitcoin, with Strategy alone accounting for approximately $74 billion of that total. BREAKING: STRATEGY BUYS ANOTHER 390 #BITCOIN FOR $43.4 MILLION pic.twitter.com/0pjWpC1Syh— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 27, 2025 The emergence of Bitcoin treasury companies has accelerated notably in 2025, with Germany’s aifinyo AG recently announcing plans to accumulate 10,000 BTC by 2027. This follows similar moves by companies across Europe and Asia, signaling a broader institutional acceptance of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. The Bitcoin treasury model has moved from experimental to established corporate strategy. We’re seeing new companies enter this space almost weekly, recognizing Bitcoin as the ultimate treasury reserve asset. Bitcoin’s price responded positively to Strategy’s announcement, trading above $115,000 as of press time. Bitcoin has shown strong momentum in recent days, supported by growing institutional adoption and the approaching 2026 halving. Strategy’s stock (MSTR) has also shown positive movement, rising 3% in pre-market. Recent regulatory developments have further supported the Bitcoin treasury trend. Strategy recently received favorable guidance from the IRS and Treasury regarding the treatment of unrealized crypto gains in Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax (CAMT) calculations, eliminating concerns about potential tax liabilities for long-term Bitcoin holdings. As more companies adopt Bitcoin treasury strategies and regulatory frameworks become clearer, the trend appears poised to continue. With Strategy leading the way and new entrants like aifinyo AG joining the space, corporate Bitcoin adoption is increasingly becoming a global phenomenon, spanning various industries and regions.

This post Trump-Backed American Bitcoin Adds 1,414 Bitcoin Amid U.S. Expansion first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Micah Zimmerman. Bitcoin Magazine Trump-Backed American Bitcoin Adds 1,414 Bitcoin Amid U.S. Expansion American Bitcoin Corp. (Nasdaq: ABTC), a Trump family–backed mining platform, has expanded its Bitcoin holdings to 3,865 bitcoin, adding 1,414 bitcoin since September through a combination of mining production and secondary market purchases. The Miami-based firm, which describes itself as “America’s Bitcoin infrastructure backbone,” said the latest accumulation includes coins held in custody and those pledged for miner purchases under its ongoing procurement deal with Bitmain. The update continues a rapid expansion trajectory that began earlier this year when Hut 8 spun out its U.S. mining arm as a separate, publicly traded entity. American Bitcoin initially held around 500 BTC at the time of the carve-out, then purchased another 1,726 BTC between July and August for approximately $205 million. Those holdings were pledged to Bitmain as collateral for a $314 million order of 16,299 Antminer U3S21EXPH units — nearly the full 15 EH/s option under the companies’ strategic supply agreement. Most of those machines will be hosted at Hut 8’s new Vega site in Texas, a 400-megawatt facility central to American Bitcoin’s push toward 25 EH/s of proprietary hashrate. “We believe one of the most important measures of success for a Bitcoin accumulation platform is how much Bitcoin backs each share,” said Eric Trump, co-founder and chief strategy officer. “As part of that conviction, we are focused on providing transparent updates as we aim to increase our holdings.” JUST IN: Trump Family-backed BTC miner American Bitcoin acquires 1,414 Bitcoin.They now hold 3,865 Bitcoin pic.twitter.com/21dgPKboOG— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 27, 2025 Executive Chairman Asher Genoot added that American Bitcoin’s integrated mining model allows it to lower its average cost per Bitcoin compared with treasury-style vehicles that buy on the open market. “That structural advantage allows us to compound Bitcoin value per share more efficiently for our investors,” he said. Shares of ABTC have been volatile since their September debut, rising 11% on Friday to close at $5.62 after recovering from midweek lows below $5. The company, valued around $5.1 billion, remains one of the most closely watched plays in the sector — both for its aggressive expansion plans and its deep ties to the Trump family. At the time of writing, the stock is trading at $5.83 and Bitcoin is trading at $115,000 after a couple of tumultuous weeks. Gryphon, American Bitcoin merger Earlier this year, Gryphon Digital Mining merged with American Bitcoin Corp., the Trump family–backed subsidiary of Hut 8, to form what they claim could become the most efficient pure-play Bitcoin miner in the industry. The all-stock merger saw Gryphon shareholders own about 2% of the combined entity and American Bitcoin stakeholders hold 98%. The merger, now finalized, provides American Bitcoin with a faster route to public markets and combines Gryphon’s mining technology with American Bitcoin’s capital strength and large-scale reserve strategy.

Bitcoin Magazine One Bitcoin a Day: Prenetics Raises $48M to Accelerate Bitcoin Treasury Strategy Does one bitcoin a day keep the doctor away? Prenetics Global Limited (NASDAQ: PRE), a Hong Kong-based health sciences company, announced today the successful pricing of a public equity offering expected to generate approximately $48 million in gross proceeds, with the potential to raise up to $216 million if all accompanying warrants are exercised. The capital raise is intended to support the expansion of its supplement brand, IM8, while bolstering Prenetics’ Bitcoin treasury strategy. The company has a disciplined Bitcoin accumulation plan, purchasing one bitcoin per day since August 1, 2025, and currently holds approximately 275 BTC, valued at $31 million as of October 27. Prenetics said the offering attracted a distinguished group of institutional and individual investors, including major crypto platforms and financial firms such as Kraken, Exodus (NYSE: EXOD), GPTX by Bitcoin mining pioneer Jihan Wu, American Ventures LLC, XtalPi (2228.HK), DL Holdings (1709.HK), and Mythos Group, among others. The offering, led by sole placement agent Dominari Securities LLC, consists of 2,992,596 Class A ordinary shares and/or pre-funded warrants, along with Class A and Class B warrants exercisable for up to 5,985,192 additional shares. The Class A warrants carry an exercise price of $24.12 — 50% above the offering price of $16.08 — while the Class B warrants are exercisable at $32.16, or a 100% premium. Both warrants are immediately exercisable upon issuance and have five-year terms. High-profile strategic investors like Aryna Sabalenka, the world No. 1 tennis player, and Adrian Cheng, a prominent Asian entrepreneur, also increased their stakes in the company. David Beckham is also a prominent backer. Prenetics’ supplement brand IM8 hit $100 million ARR in 11 months and aims for $180–$200 million in 2026 within the $704 billion global market, the company said. CEO Danny Yeung highlighted the company’s dual focus on health supplements and cryptocurrency. “IM8 has huge global potential, evidenced already by our extraordinary traction across multiple markets. We’re particularly honored to have the backing of a distinguished group of new and existing strategic investors who share our confidence in our dual-engine strategy,” Yeung said. Bitcoin accumulation: One bitcoin per day As mentioned earlier, Prenetics has a Bitcoin accumulation plan, purchasing one bitcoin per day since August 1, 2025, and currently holds approximately 275 BTC, valued at $31 million as of October 27. Financially, Prenetics will hold roughly $100 million in cash post-offering, bringing its total liquidity — including Bitcoin holdings — to around $131 million. The company also plans to review and divest non-core business units to focus resources on IM8 and Bitcoin initiatives. The offering is expected to close on or around October 28, 2025, pending customary conditions. Prenetics positions itself as pursuing a bold long-term ambition: to reach $1 billion in annual revenue alongside $1 billion in Bitcoin holdings within the next five years, combining health supplement growth with cryptocurrency accumulation as a cornerstone of its corporate strategy. IM8’s operational performance underscores the brand’s subscription-driven growth model, with more than 12 million servings shipped to over 420,000 customer orders across 31 countries. Average order values have risen from $110 to $145 following the launch of IM8’s Daily Ultimate Longevity product, reflecting strong consumer demand for premium offerings.

This post IBM Launches “Digital Asset Haven” to Help Banks and Governments Enter into Crypto first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Micah Zimmerman. Bitcoin Magazine IBM Launches “Digital Asset Haven” to Help Banks and Governments Enter into Crypto IBM announced a platform designed to help financial institutions, governments, and large corporations securely manage their crypto and blockchain-based assets, like bitcoin. The platform, developed in collaboration with crypto wallet provider Dfns, combines IBM’s infrastructure and security expertise with Dfns’ institutional-grade custody and wallet technology. At its core, Digital Asset Haven wants to simplify what has long been a tricky and complex landscape for institutions. Many banks and governments have been cautious about crypto because it involves multiple blockchains, regulatory hurdles, and security risks. IBM’s platform wants to change this and consolidate these moving parts, offering a single solution. The partnership with Dfns is central to the platform. Dfns has built more than 15 million wallets for over 250 clients, focusing on secure and compliant operations. By combining this with IBM’s high-assurance infrastructure, Digital Asset Haven is meant to provide institutions with the same reliability and governance standards that traditional financial systems offer. That includes multi-party approvals, policy-driven governance, and support for cold storage, where crypto keys are kept offline for maximum security. IBM’s support for 40 blockchains The platform also supports more than 40 blockchains, both public and private, giving institutions flexibility to engage with a wide range of digital assets, from traditional cryptocurrencies to emerging stablecoins and tokenized assets. It integrates third-party services for identity verification, anti-money laundering checks, and yield generation, and offers developer-friendly APIs to enable further customization and innovation. “This is more than custody,” said Clarisse Hagège, CEO of Dfns. “We’ve built a platform that orchestrates the full digital asset ecosystem, moving digital assets from pilot programs to production at a global scale.” Tom McPherson, General Manager of IBM Z and LinuxONE, emphasized that the platform brings IBM’s signature resilience and data governance to the emerging digital asset space, helping institutions explore new products without compromising on security or compliance. The launch comes at a time when regulated digital assets are gaining momentum. Stablecoins, for example, have become increasingly used in payments following the U.S. adoption of legislation earlier this year, and major banks are exploring blockchain-based money transfers.

This post S&P Assigns ‘B-’ Rating to Strategy (MSTR), Citing Bitcoin Exposure and Liquidity Risk first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Micah Zimmerman. Bitcoin Magazine S&P Assigns ‘B-’ Rating to Strategy (MSTR), Citing Bitcoin Exposure and Liquidity Risk S&P Global Ratings assigned a ‘B-’ issuer credit rating to bitcoin-juggernaut Strategy, reflecting the company’s heavy concentration in bitcoin and limited dollar liquidity. The outlook is stable. S&P said the rating reflects Strategy’s “high bitcoin concentration, narrow business focus, weak risk-adjusted capitalization, and low U.S. dollar liquidity.” The company reported $8.1 billion in pre-tax earnings in the first half of 2025, almost entirely from appreciation in the value of its bitcoin holdings. The firm said in their release that while Strategy’s balance sheet is dominated by bitcoin, its management has prudently staggered debt maturities and maintained flexibility by financing primarily with equity. In other words, this rating means Strategy can meet debt obligations for now but faces significant default risk if market conditions worsen. Strategy — now effectively a bitcoin treasury company — raises capital through equity and debt issuances to purchase and hold bitcoin. Its securities give investors varying exposure to bitcoin across its capital structure. Just today, founder and former CEO Michael Saylor announced a purchase of 390 BTC between October 20 and October 26, spending approximately $43.4 million at an average price of $111,053 per Bitcoin. The firm still operates a small AI-powered analytics business, though it remains roughly breakeven. JUST IN: S&P Global Ratings has rated a #Bitcoin treasury company for the first time — Michael Saylor’s Strategy pic.twitter.com/oP4j5UIJlj— Bitcoin Magazine (@BitcoinMagazine) October 27, 2025 A Strategy first This S&P rating is the first-ever rating of a Bitcoin Treasury Company by a major credit rating agency. According to S&P, Strategy’s risk-adjusted capital ratio was significantly negative as of June 30, 2025, because the agency deducts bitcoin assets from equity in its calculation. Strategy reported $8.1 billion in pre-tax earnings in the first half of 2025. Operating cash flow during the period was negative $37 million. The agency cited several key risks, including a currency mismatch between Strategy’s bitcoin-denominated assets and dollar-denominated obligations such as interest, debt principal, and preferred dividends. S&P also pointed to cybersecurity risks given the company’s reliance on custodians to safeguard its bitcoin. Strategy holds bitcoin valued at roughly $70 billion, against $8 billion in convertible debt, much of which matures beginning in 2028. Annual preferred dividends total about $640 million, which the company plans to fund through additional stock and preferred equity issuance. While Strategy’s access to capital markets remains a core strength, S&P warned that a sharp decline in bitcoin prices or loss of investor confidence could impede its ability to refinance debt or pay dividends, potentially leading to bitcoin sales “at severely depressed prices.” S&P said the rating could be downgraded if access to markets weakens or debt management risks rise. An upgrade is unlikely unless the company improves its U.S. dollar liquidity or reduces reliance on convertible debt. Strategy’s trillion-dollar endgame Earlier this year, Michael Saylor laid out an ambitious plan to reshape global finance through Bitcoin. In an interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Saylor described an “endgame” in which Strategy accumulates a trillion-dollar bitcoin balance sheet, growing 20–30% annually, and uses it as the foundation for a new global credit system. At the core of his vision is scale: with enough BTC on corporate balance sheets, the long-term appreciation of Bitcoin — historically around 21% annually — would supercharge the capital base. On top of that, Saylor sees an opportunity to issue bitcoin-backed credit at yields significantly higher than traditional fiat-based debt, potentially two to four percentage points above corporate or sovereign rates. He argued that over-collateralization could make this system safer than even AAA-rated debt, while simultaneously fueling broader financial growth. Saylor’s vision extends beyond credit markets. As Bitcoin becomes embedded in corporations, banks, insurers, and sovereign wealth funds, public equity indexes could gradually become indirect bitcoin vehicles. This, he says, would benefit equity markets and corporate balance sheets while introducing higher yields and greater transparency into financial products. The implications are broad: savings accounts could yield 8–10% instead of near-zero, money market funds could be denominated in bitcoin, and insurance products could be reimagined around bitcoin collateral.

This post Bitcoin Closes at $114,530 Amid FOMC Volatility: Bulls Eye $117,600 Resistance first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Ethan Greene - Feral Analysis and Juan Galt. Bitcoin Magazine Bitcoin Closes at $114,530 Amid FOMC Volatility: Bulls Eye $117,600 Resistance Bitcoin Price Weekly Outlook Bitcoin’s price action was rather subdued last week, keeping traders guessing whether or not we would see another large drop in price entering the weekend. Price held above the lows, however, slowly plodding a little bit higher to close out the week at $114,530. Bulls should not be overly disappointed with this price action, as they did reclaim the $112,200 resistance level, and are now closing in on conquering the next resistance level at $115,500. The bears are still sitting comfortably in control, though, with stronger resistance levels hanging overhead that the bulls have yet to challenge. This may be an interesting and volatile week ahead, with the FOMC meeting on Wednesday and a slough of large companies reporting third-quarter earnings. Key Support and Resistance Levels Now Nothing has materially changed from last week’s resistance levels as the bulls have made little progress. Heavy resistance is still sitting at $117,600 and $122,000 above there, so the bears aren’t feeling any real pressure yet. If by chance this week gets above $122,000, we will look to the upper boundary of our broadening wedge pattern at $128,000. Holding above the prior week’s low is a positive sign for the bulls, while they managed to maintain price above the key short-term support of $106,900 last week as well. This level must hold going forward, as closing below $106,900 opens the door back down to the $105,000 to $102,000 support zone that has already been tested twice. A third test of this support zone would be more likely to break it than to hold it. $96,000 is the long-term bull market support below here, a do-or-die support level if the price were to slide down and test it. Outlook For This Week Expect significant volatility this week, especially on Wednesday, as we have the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision and ensuing Powell speech, followed by major earnings reports from Microsoft, Meta, and Google after market close. Bulls will look to hold $109,000 as a floor into this week, as doing so would position them to maintain upward momentum. Looking at the Momentum Reversal Indicator, we are currently sitting on an 8-count entering Monday. This is a warning candle that we may see momentum begin to fade. Tuesday should bring the 9-count at which point we should expect at least a pause on upward momentum and a 1 to 4 day correction in price. So if bulls can push price up to the 0.618 Fibonacci Retracement at $117,600 by Monday night or Tuesday morning, we should expect to see a rejection ther,e and we can re-assess after Wednesday’s FOMC and earnings reports play out. Market mood: Bearish – While the bulls gained some ground last week, the bears remain stoic and strong. The bulls must push the price past $122,000 to take back control. The next few weeks If bulls can manage to survive through this week, there are still some potential headwinds on the horizon. The US-China tariff dispute may or may not be resolved by the end of next week; a negative outcome will likely send all markets lower. Additionally, the US courts’ ruling on the legality of Trump’s tariffs is expected by November 5th. If these tariffs are reinstated, we should expect markets to head lower to price this impact in. Terminology Guide: Bulls/Bullish: Buyers or investors expecting the price to go higher. Bears/Bearish: Sellers or investors expecting the price to go lower. Support or support level: A level at which the price should hold for the asset, at least initially. The more touches on support, the weaker it gets and the more likely it is to fail to hold the price. Resistance or resistance level: Opposite of support. The level that is likely to reject the price, at least initially. The more touches at resistance, the weaker it gets and the more likely it is to fail to hold back the price. Fibonacci Retracements and Extensions: Ratios based on what is known as the golden ratio, a universal ratio pertaining to growth and decay cycles in nature. The golden ratio is based on the constants Phi (1.618) and phi (0.618). Broadening Wedge: A chart pattern consisting of an upper trend line acting as resistance and a lower trend line acting as support. These trend lines must diverge away from each other in order to validate the pattern. This pattern is a result of expanding price volatility, typically resulting in higher highs and lower lows. Momentum Reversal Indicator (MRI): A proprietary indicator created by Tone Vays. The MRI indicator tracks buyer and seller momentum and exhaustion, providing signals to indicate when to expect momentum to fade and accelerate.

This post Strategy (MSTR) Earns S&P ‘B-’ Rating, Marking a Major Milestone for Bitcoin-Backed Credit first appeared on Bitcoin Magazine and is written by Nick Ward. Bitcoin Magazine Strategy (MSTR) Earns S&P ‘B-’ Rating, Marking a Major Milestone for Bitcoin-Backed Credit For the first time in financial history, a major credit rating agency has formally evaluated a company built on a bitcoin-backed credit model. In news covered by Bitcoin Magazine, the S&P Global Ratings has assigned Strategy Inc (MSTR) a ‘B-’ Issuer Credit Rating with a Stable outlook, recognizing not just the company, but the emergence of Bitcoin as collateral inside the credit system. This marks a watershed moment for corporate finance. Bitcoin-backed credit is no longer theoretical. It is now a rated financial reality. Why This Moment Matters Until now, Bitcoin had been accepted by equity markets, ETFs, and corporate treasury conversations — but credit markets remained untouched. Credit markets are where legitimacy is ultimately decided because they determine who can borrow, at what cost, and against which assets. By rating Strategy Inc, S&P has implicitly acknowledged: Bitcoin can underpin structured debt and preferred equity. A bitcoin-backed credit strategy can be modeled, rated, and priced using traditional frameworks. Bitcoin is shifting from speculative asset to recognized collateral within corporate capital structures. This is not a marketing milestone — it is a structural one. Bitcoin has entered the language of risk-adjusted return, yield, and covenants. How S&P Interpreted Strategy’s Bitcoin-Backed Capital Model The rating is speculative grade, but the Stable outlook is critical. It signals S&P’s belief that Strategy can continue to service obligations and access capital markets without selling its Bitcoin reserves — a foundational principle of bitcoin-backed credit. S&P’s analysis mentions several possible weaknesses: High concentration of assets in Bitcoin Low U.S. dollar liquidity and negative risk-adjusted capital under S&P’s methodology Currency mismatch: long Bitcoin, short U.S. dollar debt obligations Limited operating cash flow outside software revenue However, they also credited Strategy with unique structural strengths: No near-term debt maturities before 2027–2028 Proven access to capital markets — both equity and debt A capital stack purpose-built to accumulate Bitcoin without diluting shareholders Active liability management via convertible debt and preferred stock instruments In short, S&P is signaling that bitcoin-backed credit can function — if managed with discipline. Implications for the S&P 500 and Institutional Legitimacy Strategy Inc met the S&P 500 inclusion criteria in profitability and market capitalization but was passed over in 2024, widely believed to be due to its Bitcoin-heavy balance sheet. That decision now appears less defensible. With a formal credit rating, the company shifts from “unrated anomaly” to “rated issuer.” For institutional capital, that distinction matters. Index committees can now reference a risk rating — not just a narrative. Treasury teams and insurers can benchmark exposure to bitcoin-backed credit against traditional corporate debt. This increases (not guarantees) the probability of future index inclusion and passive capital flows. Bitcoin entering equity indices begins with Bitcoin entering the credit models behind them. Bitcoin-Backed Credit: The Ideal State of Treasury Strategy This rating does more than validate Strategy — it validates the architecture of bitcoin-backed credit as the superior evolution of corporate treasury management. Phase 1 was equity-funded Bitcoin accumulation — high growth but shareholder dilution.Phase 2 introduced convertible debt and preferred equity — allowing companies to acquire Bitcoin through capital markets rather than operating earnings.Phase 3, now underway, is full institutional recognition of bitcoin-backed credit — rated, benchmarked, and capable of scaling. This is the endgame: Use capital markets to borrow in fiat Use proceeds to acquire Bitcoin Service liabilities without selling reserves Increase Bitcoin-per-share over time, without issuing new common stock With S&P formally rating Strategy’s issuer credit, this model moves from innovation to infrastructure. Why Corporate Finance Leaders Need to Pay Attention This rating does not compel companies to adopt Bitcoin. But it removes the claim that Bitcoin cannot be integrated into traditional credit systems. From now on: Bitcoin can be factored into risk-weighted capital models and treasury policy. Credit and liquidity committees must understand how bitcoin-backed credit affects financing costs, refinancing risk, and balance sheet leverage. Investors can now compare Bitcoin-based capital structures against other high-yield or hybrid debt strategies. Boards can no longer dismiss Bitcoin as “unratable” or “unclassified.” A New Chapter for Corporate Finance and Capital Markets What makes this moment different isn’t that another institution “acknowledged” Bitcoin. That’s happened before with ETFs, GAAP accounting changes, and treasury allocations. What’s different is where the recognition has now occurred: Not in equity markets. Not in payment networks. But in credit — the foundation of corporate finance and monetary systems. When a credit rating agency like S&P evaluates a company built on Bitcoin, it does three things that have never happened before: It forces Bitcoin into risk models normally reserved for banks, sovereigns, and investment-grade corporations. It legitimizes bitcoin-backed credit as a structure that can be analyzed, refinanced, and scaled — not dismissed as speculative. It signals to other corporates and lenders that they must now understand Bitcoin not as an investment, but as collateral. This rating does not mean the model is risk-free. It means the model is real enough to underwrite, stress test, and lend against. That is the real inflection point — not that S&P approved of Bitcoin, but that they were forced to measure it.

Bitcoin Magazine Bitcoin Price Jumps to $115,000 As Analyst Says It May Never Fall Below $100K Again Bitcoin price surged to $115,000 on Monday, rising more than 1% in 24 hours, as optimism over easing U.S.–China trade tensions and renewed investor appetite for risk assets lifted global markets. According to Geoffrey Kendrick, Head of Digital Asset Research at Standard Chartered Bank, Bitcoin price may “never fall below $100,000 again” if this week’s macro tailwinds continue. In a note to clients, Kendrick said that improving trade relations between Washington and Beijing have flipped last week’s market fear into “hope.” U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent’s weekend statement that restrictions on China’s rare earth exports could be postponed for a year, combined with reports that Beijing plans to buy large quantities of U.S. soybeans, sparked a relief rally across equities, commodities, and crypto. China, U.S trade deals and FOMC rate cuts The agreement, expected to be finalized after the upcoming Trump–Xi summit in South Korea, has renewed risk appetite and pushed the bitcoin-to-gold ratio back above pre-October 10 levels — the date when 100% tariff threats sent markets tumbling. Kendrick pointed to fresh inflows into spot bitcoin ETFs as another key signal of strength. Over $2 billion exited U.S. gold ETFs late last week, and if even half of that re-enters bitcoin funds, he said, it would mark a major vote of confidence. The analyst also highlighted macro tailwinds, including expectations for a 25-basis-point rate cut at Wednesday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting — a move widely seen as bullish for bitcoin. Meanwhile, investors are watching a packed earnings calendar from both tech and crypto heavyweights. Microsoft, Meta, and Google are set to report on Wednesday, followed by Apple, Amazon, Coinbase, and Strategy (formerly MicroStrategy) later in the week. “If this week goes well — bitcoin may never fall below $100,000 again,” Kendrick said. Bitcoin price outlook While bulls have made modest progress with Bitcoin, stronger resistance remains overhead at $117,600 and $122,000, leaving bears largely in control. If Bitcoin manages to surpass $122,000, professionals note the next target could be the upper boundary of a broadening wedge pattern at $128,000. Support levels remain critical for maintaining bullish momentum. The key short-term support at $106,900 held throughout last week, helping stabilize the market. Falling below this level could open the path toward the $105,000–$102,000 support zone, which has already been tested twice, with a third test raising the likelihood of a breakdown. Beyond that, $96,000 represents a crucial long-term support level for the broader bull market, acting as a do-or-die floor if prices decline further. As of press time, bitcoin was trading at $115,041, up 1.22% over the past 24 hours.

Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is the black sheep of the blockchain world, and that’s by design. It doesn’t use a traditional blockchain. Instead, it runs on a patented data structure called a hashgraph, which claims to be faster, more secure and infinitely more efficient. It’s not trying to beat Ethereum at its own game. It’s trying to rewrite the whole playbook. Built for enterprise-scale adoption and governed by a council of global corporations like Google, IBM and LG, Hedera is going after the suit-and-tie crowd. Think less DAO and more Fortune 500. If it works, HBAR could be the infrastructure layer that powers everything from digital ID systems to carbon offset marketplaces to tokenized assets for mega-corps. But that strategy comes with trade-offs. Permissioned council governance, sluggish retail adoption and a utility model that’s still proving itself make HBAR one of the most polarizing assets in crypto. Some call it the future of enterprise blockchain. Others call it corporate crypto cosplay. Table of contents [Show] 2025 HBAR Price Prediction 2026 HBAR Price Prediction 2030 HBAR Price Prediction Reasons to Invest in Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Factors That Could Slow Hedera’s Growth Price Prediction Methodology Aggregate Analyst Forecasts Market Trends & Adoption Analysis Macroeconomic Factors Frequently Asked Questions 2025 HBAR Price Prediction The price range reflects cautious optimism around network growth. Hedera has signed deals with supply chain platforms, stablecoin issuers and carbon markets and these could begin to translate into meaningful on-chain volume. Still, the market is clearly waiting for more proof. Retail adoption remains thin and most users couldn’t name a dApp running on Hedera if their lives depended on it. The upper-end forecast of assumes a successful rollout of key use cases and a few splashy partnerships. But unless Hedera starts generating real transaction demand that translates to consistent network usage, price gains could stay stuck in neutral. 2026 HBAR Price Prediction Things could get rougher in 2026. If Hedera fails to convert more enterprise pilots into real-world applications with visible metrics and adoption, HBAR’s utility could remain underwhelming. Hedera has all the paperwork and partnerships in place, but what it needs now is users, consumers, developers and enterprises pushing actual volume. Without that, HBAR risks becoming a case study in great tech with nowhere to go. That said, the ceiling in the forecast still leaves room for a rebound. Hedera could re-emerge as a sleeper play if macro conditions turn bullish and enterprise integrations scale. 2030 HBAR Price Prediction If enterprises continue to use the network through prepaid accounts or private integrations that don’t actually touch HBAR on-chain, there’s a hard ceiling on demand. The token becomes more of a back end utility chip than a value-accruing asset. The low-end forecast of reflects a scenario including stalled adoption, council stagnation and a shrinking retail investor base. Reasons to Invest in Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Hedera still offers a differentiated value proposition. Its underlying hashgraph consensus is fast, low-latency and incredibly scalable compared to traditional blockchains. It avoids forks, handles thousands of transactions per second and finalizes in seconds. That’s not nothing. It also has one of the most credible governance structures in crypto. The Hedera Governing Council includes some of the world’s largest and most recognizable companies, which adds legitimacy and stability to the protocol. Hedera may be one of their first stops if enterprises ever go all in on decentralized tech. HBAR is also carbon-negative, with built-in tools to support ESG-focused applications, which may play well in a more regulation-heavy, climate-conscious future. Factors That Could Slow Hedera’s Growth Let’s cut through the PR gloss: Hedera has yet to prove its tech advantage translates into market leadership. There’s little evidence of robust organic growth from builders or users for all the corporate logos and press releases. Its enterprise-first strategy is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it’s unique. On the other, it’s slow, bureaucratic and less transparent than ecosystems where usage is visible and on-chain. If adoption doesn’t show up in the form of HBAR demand, investors may have difficulty staying interested. Then there’s the tokenomics. Hedera’s total supply is large and the release schedule is long. If use cases don’t catch up to supply emissions, price pressure could intensify especially in bear markets. And as more modular and interoperable L1s emerge, Hedera could find itself boxed out of the most dynamic parts of Web3. Price Prediction Methodology Our HBAR forecast blends multiple layers of research to provide a grounded, realistic view through 2030. Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We compiled price predictions from respected crypto platforms including WalletInvestor, CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice. These provide each forecasted year’s low, average and high estimates. Market Trends & Adoption Analysis Hedera is focused on enterprise blockchain infrastructure. Our analysis weighed current integrations, partnerships and ecosystem updates to assess whether HBAR usage will likely grow or stagnate. Macroeconomic Factors HBAR is highly sensitive to institutional sentiment and the regulatory climate. If enterprise blockchain gets regulatory tail winds or tax incentives, Hedera could gain traction. But if the market shifts toward full decentralization or if tokenization happens on other chains with more open ecosystems, HBAR could lag behind. Frequently Asked Questions Q Will Hedera Hashgraph reach $100? 1 Will Hedera Hashgraph reach $100? asked 2025-10-27 Ryan Peterson A 1 Based on current projections and Hedera’s utility model, HBAR reaching $100 is highly unlikely. Even optimistic 2030 forecasts top out at $0.106, reflecting cautious expectations about retail demand and token utility. Answer Link answered 2025-10-27 Benzinga Q How much is HBAR worth in 2025? 1 How much is HBAR worth in 2025? asked 2025-10-27 Ryan Peterson A 1 HBAR is expected to trade between $0.124 and $0.200 in 2025, with an average forecast of $0.151. This outlook reflects moderate optimism tied to enterprise adoption, but real growth depends on whether Hedera can generate consistent on-chain volume. Answer Link answered 2025-10-27 Benzinga Q What makes Hedera Hashgraph different from other blockchains? 1 What makes Hedera Hashgraph different from other blockchains? asked 2025-10-27 Ryan Peterson A 1 Unlike traditional blockchains, Hedera uses a patented hashgraph consensus mechanism, which allows for faster transaction speeds, low fees and greater energy efficiency. Its unique governance model – led by a council of global corporations like Google, IBM and LG – also sets it apart from community-driven blockchains. That enterprise-first strategy appeals to institutions but has yet to generate widespread retail adoption.

Feeling confident about this CAKE price prediction? You can trade PancakeSwap on Coinbase—and if you’re new to the platform, you could earn up to $400 in rewards by completing a few quick educational lessons and making your first qualifying trade. PancakeSwap (CAKE) has long been the go-to decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, offering cheap trades, yield farming and sweet, sweet staking rewards. But while it used to dominate the DeFi leaderboard, today’s landscape is a bit less syrupy. With token emissions outpacing demand and competition heating up across L2s and altchains, CAKE’s future isn’t as cut and dry. Still, PancakeSwap is far from irrelevant. The platform continues to burn CAKE tokens, upgrade its features and remain a low-fee favorite. But the real question is whether this DEX token can reclaim its former glory or if it’ll slowly get flipped by faster, flashier competitors. Table of contents [Show] 2025 CAKE Price Prediction 2026 CAKE Price Prediction 2030 CAKE Price Prediction Reasons to Invest in PancakeSwap (CAKE) Factors That Could Slow PancakeSwap’s Growth Price Prediction Methodology Aggregate Analyst Forecasts Market Trends & Ecosystem Analysis Macroeconomic Factors Frequently Asked Questions 2025 CAKE Price Prediction CAKE could see moderate bullish momentum in 2025. While it’s not moon-bound, the projection assumes a recovery in DEX trading volumes and DeFi user activity. If market confidence in Binance Smart Chain returns (despite Ethereum L2s eating its lunch), PancakeSwap may reestablish itself as a reliable low-fee alternative. This isn’t about hype, this is about resilience in a maturing DeFi space. The high-end estimate assumes increased staking participation, solid token burns offsetting emissions and broader BSC ecosystem growth. But it’s a tightrope walk. And one misstep (like fewer incentives or BNB ecosystem weakness) and CAKE could lose heat fast. 2026 CAKE Price Prediction In 2026, CAKE may slide into consolidation mode. The muted outlook likely reflects market fatigue and the emergence of stronger DEX players on Ethereum rollups and modular chains. As DeFi infrastructure evolves, users demand more than swaps and syrup pools. They want real interoperability, advanced order routing and token utility that doesn’t rely solely on inflationary rewards. If PancakeSwap can adapt by integrating cross-chain functionality, launching unique DeFi tools or improving CAKE’s governance power, it may still outperform some legacy tokens. But without those upgrades, it risks becoming a second-tier player with limited upside. 2030 CAKE Price Prediction By 2030, long-term forecasts take a bullish turn. Reasons to Invest in PancakeSwap (CAKE) For all its challenges, PancakeSwap remains one of the largest DEXs in crypto by user count and total value locked on BSC. That matters. A loyal base still farming rewards, swapping tokens and engaging with the protocol daily. CAKE also benefits from a few enduring advantages: Low transaction fees thanks to BSC’s infrastructure Frequent token burns aimed at curbing inflation A well-known brand and user-friendly UI Continuous updates including prediction markets, gaming integrations and new staking options For investors looking to bet on established DeFi platforms rather than risky, unproven alternatives, CAKE might still be a compelling choice especially at a discount. Factors That Could Slow PancakeSwap’s Growth CAKE’s tokenomics are a double-edged sword. While the project regularly burns a decent chunk of supply, its emissions remain high and rewards are still the primary driver of demand. That’s a tough game to win long-term. Other red flags include: Declining BNB chain usage compared to Ethereum L2s Minimal differentiation in a crowded DEX market Risk of regulatory pressure on incentive-based platforms User migration to newer protocols offering better returns Unless PancakeSwap seriously levels its value proposition beyond token swaps and yield farming, CAKE may slowly lose relevance to smarter, faster competitors. And if DeFi continues consolidating around a handful of ecosystems, BSC’s dominance could shrink, taking PancakeSwap with it. Price Prediction Methodology Our CAKE price forecast through 2030 combines multiple research angles to create a balanced view of its potential. Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We aggregated price predictions from trusted platforms like WalletInvestor, CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice. These forecasts provided the low, average and high estimates used in each year’s section. Market Trends & Ecosystem Analysis We analyzed on-chain metrics such as user growth, total value locked and DEX trading volume across the Binance ecosystem. These data points influenced our understanding of PancakeSwap’s current standing and future outlook. Macroeconomic Factors Like all altcoins, CAKE is at the mercy of macro market conditions. Rising interest rates, tightening regulations or waning investor appetite for risk assets could hurt CAKE’s performance regardless of what’s happening on-chain. Conversely, a renewed bull market or a DeFi resurgence could breathe new life into the token. Frequently Asked Questions Q How much will PancakeSwap cost in 2025? 1 How much will PancakeSwap cost in 2025? asked 2025-10-27 Gianluca Miller A 1 PancakeSwap (CAKE) could reach a high of $2.53 in 2025 with an average price prediction of $2.05. This forecast reflects a potential recovery in DeFi trading volumes and token staking activity.

Myro (MYRO), a meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain in November 2023, is inspired by Solana cofounder Raj Gokal’s dog. Built on Solana’s efficient proof-of-participation network boasting 10,000 nodes globally, Myro facilitates swift, tax-free transactions appealing to a broad audience. While rooted in meme culture, Myro distinguishes itself by leveraging the Solana blockchain’s capabilities and fostering community engagement. Beyond its playful origins, Myro aims to provide practical utility through exclusive merchandise, event access and innovative tools like the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App to bridge the gap between meme-driven hype and real-world application. Table of contents [Show] 2025 Myro Price Prediction 2026 Myro Price Prediction 2030 Myro Price Prediction Reasons to Invest in Myro Factors That Could Slow Myro’s Growth Price Predictions from Analysts Market Sentiment and Social Trends Speculative Demand and Hype Cycles Broader Market Factors Frequently Asked Questions 2025 Myro Price Prediction Technical indicators reflect a bearish sentiment and the Fear & Greed Index has an Extreme Fear reading of 25. Despite the long-term price prediction, CoinCodex’s analysis suggests that purchasing Myro now may not be advisable. 2026 Myro Price Prediction For 2026, February is predicted to be the most bullish month, potentially seeing a 178.43% price increase from its current value. 2030 Myro Price Prediction By 2030, Myro is projected to grow substantially, with the forecast implying a potential return on investment of 353.67%, reflecting a strongly bullish sentiment for the year. Reasons to Invest in Myro Myro’s integration with the Solana blockchain, its community-driven nature and the possibility of high returns associated with meme coin volatility are among the reasons to invest in it. Investors should consider: Solana Blockchain Integration: Myro’s foundation on the Solana blockchain provides potential advantages in terms of transaction speed and efficiency. Solana’s high throughput and low fees contribute to Myro’s usability and appeal. Utility and Development: The project’s efforts to develop practical utilities such as the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App could move the token beyond meme status. If these features gain traction, they could add real-world value to it. Potential for High Returns: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and meme coins in particular can experience significant price swings. While investing in meme coins is risky, it is also possible to see substantial returns for those who time their investments well. Factors That Could Slow Myro’s Growth Because it’s a meme coin, Myro is volatile with values heavily influenced by fleeting hype and speculative trends. If the initial enthusiasm declines or if negative sentiment takes hold, Myro’s price could experience a sharp decline. The perception of meme coins as purely speculative assets could deter serious long-term investors and limit sustained growth. Myro’s dependence on the Solana blockchain also makes it vulnerable – any issues affecting the Solana network, such as outages or security breaches, could impact Myro’s performance. Although the project is trying to transcend its meme status through initiatives like the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App, the success of the features is uncertain. If Myro fails to deliver on these promises or there is not sustained user engagement, its growth could be hindered. Price Predictions from Analysts According to CoinCodex, Myro’s price history reveals a significant range, reaching its all-time high of $0.445979 on March 9, 2024, after hitting an all-time low of $0.002125 on Nov. 14, 2023. Since its peak, Myro’s lowest price point was $0.010249 (cycle low) and its highest price since that low was $0.013344 (cycle high). The Myro price prediction is bearish with the Fear & Greed Index indicating a level of fear at 43. Myro’s circulating supply is 944.2 million MYRO out of a maximum supply of 1 billion MYRO. Regarding market capitalization, Myro has notable positions in the Solana ecosystem, ranking No. 12 in the Solana Network sector, No. 96 in the Meme Coins sector and No. 58 in the broader Solana Coins & Tokens sector. Market Sentiment and Social Trends According to Coinbase (as of April 11), MYRO generated moderate social media discussion, with 423 unique individuals contributing to online conversations, placing it at No. 165 regarding overall mentions and activities. News coverage of Myro has declined, with zero recent news articles published. On X, sentiment leans toward neutrality with 89.61% of posts expressing a neutral stance. Bullish sentiment accounts for 10.39% of posts while bearish sentiment represents only 0.73% based on a sample of 915 posts. Reddit posts tended to have more downvotes than upvotes while comments tended to receive more upvotes than downvotes. Speculative Demand and Hype Cycles Like many meme coins, Myro experiences significant price fluctuations driven by speculative demand and hype cycles which are characterized by rapid price surges fueled by social media buzz, influencer endorsements and the fear of missing out. A surge of interest can attract more investors and drive the price higher. Still, the rallies are often unsustainable because they are not usually based on fundamental value or long-term utility. As hype subsides, speculative demand declines leading to sharp price corrections. This volatility makes Myro a high-risk investment where timing is crucial. Investors who capitalize on hype cycles should know the potential for substantial losses because the market can shift abruptly. Broader Market Factors MYRO’s price movements are also influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions including Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, Federal Reserve policies and overall risk appetite in the crypto market. Historically, meme coins have closely followed Bitcoin’s trajectory, so MYRO will likely see a speculative interest surge if BTC enters a bull market. Conversely, meme coins suffer heavier losses than more fundamentally driven assets during bearish market conditions. Frequently Asked Questions Q What is Myro and why is it gaining attention in the crypto market? 1 What is Myro and why is it gaining attention in the crypto market? asked 2025-10-27 Margaret Jackson A 1 Myro (MYRO) is a meme coin launched on the Solana blockchain in November 2023, inspired by Solana cofounder Raj Gokal’s dog. Unlike typical meme coins, Myro is developing tools like a Social-Fi app and MYRO Buy Bot to create real-world utility.

Where to Store Toncoin (TON) Safely Current Crypto Prices Is Toncoin (TON) a Good Investment? Frequently Asked Questions Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction Table Based on meticulous analysis and market trends, the table below outlines the average prices for TON from 2024 to 2050: What Is Toncoin (TON)? Toncoin is a cryptocurrency functioning within a multichain project, is engineered for swift transactions and is supported by the open TON community. Initially conceived by the Durov brothers in 2018 for rapid transactions, Toncoin has expanded into a versatile platform accommodating various applications, from noncustodial wallets to decentralized exchanges and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With its proprietary TON wallet, users can execute prompt and secure blockchain-based payments without intermediaries. It operates within the Open Network blockchain, employing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model to ensure scalability and security for potentially millions of users. Will Toncoin Go Past All-Time Highs? With the TON all-time high recorded at $7.65 on Apr. 11, 2024 and the current price at $6.39, investors are curious about its potential to surpass previous highs. CertiK’s recognition of the Toncoin blockchain as the world’s fastest network further enhances TON prospects, outpacing renowned blockchains like Solana and Polygon. This achievement underscores the network’s robustness, hinting at potential price gains. Considering TON’s positive momentum, a high percentage of profitable holders, and its unparalleled network speed, there appears to be room for growth based on both pattern and market sentiment. However, it’s essential to remain vigilant of potential selling pressure, especially if it coincides with any weakening of the current uptrend signals identified through technical analysis. By closely monitoring these factors, investors can better gauge TON’s trajectory and assess its potential to surpass all-time highs. Will Toncoin Reach $10? TON’s trajectory toward reaching $10 is influenced by several key factors, including its recent performance and market dynamics. Over the past 30 days, TON has displayed a upward trend, experiencing a surge of 5.35%. This surge can be attributed to significant developments, such as Binance’s introduction of perpetual futures trading for the TON token, amplifying investor interest and driving up its value. Telegram Messenger’s decision to compensate channel owners with cryptocurrency has added to the momentum, fostering a positive outlook for Toncoin’s future. With such momentum, the outlook for TON price is optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential climb to $9.22 by the end of the month, representing a substantial 44.29% increase from its current price. In the mid-term, investors are bullish and optimistic that the recent progress in the project and overall boom structure in the market will lead the project to $10 on the second quarter of this year. Despite the promising trajectory, it’s essential to approach price predictions with caution, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While TON’s recent performance and positive news may fuel optimism, investors should conduct thorough market analysis and adhere to sound investment strategies to navigate uncertainties and fluctuations effectively. Toncoin Price History and Market Position Over its history, TON has demonstrated a robust performance in the cryptocurrency market. With an all-time high of $7.65 recorded on Apr. 11, 2024, and a current price of $6.39, TON has exhibited substantial growth potential. The cryptocurrency experienced an all-time low of $0.3906 on Sept. 20, 2021, demonstrating significant volatility over time. Presently, TON holds a market cap of $22.28 billion, ranking it No. 9 in terms of market capitalization. The circulating supply stands at 3,474,564,734 TON, with a total supply of 5,106,856,086 TON. The fully diluted market cap is estimated at $32.7 billion. Analyzing TON historical price trends shows a clear indication of an upward trajectory, with recent forecasts suggesting a potential surge to $8.18 and even $10 by the end of 2024. Toncoin operates in a competitive landscape, facing rivalry from decentralized layer-1 blockchains and cryptocurrencies offering similar features. Competitors such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) pose significant challenges, focusing on scalability, decentralized applications and smart contracts. Despite the competition, TON’s current market position, price performance and trading volume signal optimism for its future growth. The recent surge in trading volume, coupled with high profitability among holders and positive technical analysis signals, indicates potential for continued upward momentum. Investors are advised to monitor market trends and competitor activities closely to capitalize on TON’s growth potential in the cryptocurrency market. Bullish Long-Term Price Prediction for Toncoin One of the optimistic long-term price forecasts for TON originates from Digital Coin Price, a reputable source renowned for cryptocurrency analysis. According to its projections, TON is poised for a bullish trajectory, with an anticipated average price surge to $22.51 by the end of 2026. Digital Coin Price also predicts a notable escalation to $47.95 by the end of 2030, indicating substantial growth potential for TON in the long run.

Bearish Long-Term Price Prediction for Toncoin Despite numerous optimistic projections, there are also some bearish long-term price predictions for TON. TradingBeasts, a well-regarded forecast platform, foresees TON’s price hovering around $2.36 by 2026, implying a potential return on investment (ROI) of negative 64%. TradingBeasts also anticipates TON’s value to reach $3.87 by the end of 2027.

These projections collectively indicate a cautious outlook on TON’s long-term performance. TradingBeasts is recognized for providing reliable and data-driven cryptocurrency forecasts, drawing upon comprehensive market analysis and trends. A team of seasoned analysts with expertise in cryptocurrency market dynamics backs its predictions. Price Prediction, on the other hand, employs similar methodologies to generate forecasts, aiming to provide valuable insights to investors and traders.

With forecasts suggesting values around $5 to $10 by 2026 and 2027, investors may need to exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions regarding TON for their long-term portfolios. 2025 Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction 2030 Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction Where to Buy Toncoin (TON) TON can be purchased on various cryptocurrency exchanges, including OKX, Bybit, Gate.io, KuCoin, Exmo, BitMart, Bitget, Bitfinex, BigONE, HitBTC, EXOLO, XT.COM, LBank, BingX, tokenize.exchange, Coinsbit, CoinW, CoinEx, BTSE, BitoPro, CoinDCX, Richamster, NovaDAX, and Poloniex.

Positioned within the greed range, the index rarely dips into extreme fear, indicating prevailing investor optimism. The index reacts swiftly to news and short-term market shifts, making it more suited for immediate insights rather than long-term projections. While optimism prevails presently, prudent investors rely on a multifaceted approach, incorporating technical analysis and market fundamentals into their decision-making processes.

Coin collecting can feel like stepping into a glittering treasure hunt where history meets opportunity. Beyond the charm of owning tiny artifacts from distant eras, many collectors are drawn by the potential for impressive long-term returns. Rare coins often increase in value as their scarcity grows, and precious metal compositions can add an extra investment boost. Yet coin collecting isn’t just about profit; it’s a passion-driven pursuit shaped by curiosity, craftsmanship, and the joy of discovery. Whether you’re in it for wealth, wonder, or a bit of both, exploring coins as an investment invites you into a world where every piece has a story and every collection holds possibilities. BZ Key Takeaways Coins hold value based on their metal content (bullion value) and rarity (numismatic value). Successful coin investing requires patience and extensive research. Popular coins like the American Gold Eagles, Canadian Maple Leaf, and South African Krugerrands are favored by collectors. Coin collecting provides a hedge against inflation and diversifies assets. Table of contents [Show] Why are Coins Valuable? Coin Collecting for Beginners Which Coins Should You Collect? Pros and Cons of Collecting Coins Pros Cons Where to Buy Valuable Coins How to Store Coins Start Your Coin Collection Today Frequently Asked Questions Why are Coins Valuable? Coins get their value in two ways: bullion value – the metal a coin contains, such as gold or silver – and numismatic or collector’s value, which arises from its rarity and condition. The bullion value of a coin is much easier to calculate than its numismatic value – simply multiply the coin’s weight (typically in ounces) by the spot market price of the metal it contains. Numismatic value is more subjective, based on collectors’ tastes and sentiments. In general, older coins with limited minting draw a higher price. The better the condition of the coin, the higher the price. Some especially rare coins are worth millions of dollars. Coin Collecting for Beginners While the U.S. Mint says it’s easy to begin collecting coins, it’s not a pastime to jump into without understanding the basic terminology and what you’re looking for. Research and self-education play a big role in understanding coin quality, value, and rarity, and in becoming a successful coin-collecting hobbyist or investor. The first step is to find your niche. You might collect a particular historical figure, artist, country, period, or denomination. Pick a theme and let it guide your collection. Carefully examine the coins you review for purchase to become an expert and start small. Even a modest collection can be valuable. Large purchases will come in time as you gain experience. There are many ways to start collecting. Search online, join a coin-collecting club, or visit your local coin dealer. You can learn a lot by asking questions about other collectors, especially when looking for reputable dealers. All investments carry risks, and there are no guarantees with coin collecting, as it’s not regulated. You should rely on reputable collectors and dealers until you gain enough experience to protect yourself. Which Coins Should You Collect? The types of coins you start with will depend on your financial situation. Some more popular choices can give a great start to your collection and provide a hedge against inflation. Coins produced by the U.S. Mint that are popular among collectors and investors include the American Gold Eagle and the American Gold Buffalo. Staying in North America, there’s also the Canadian Gold Maple Leaf from the Royal Canadian Mint. You can also drop south of the border with the Silver Mexican Onza or to other continents for prizes like the South African Gold Krugerrand or the Chinese Gold Panda. Whichever coins you choose to start your collection, it’s important to treat them like any other asset in your portfolio: consider whether they align with your overall investing goals. Pros and Cons of Collecting Coins If you’re new to coin collecting, you’ll find a lot of positives in the hobby. However, there are also a few distinct disadvantages. Here are the pros and cons of collecting coins as an investment: Pros Hedges against inflation Has a store of value Spreads risks across different assets Provides a tangible asset Mostly uncorrelated with traditional assets Cons Price fluctuations can impact value Hard to properly assess growth without experience Requires time and effort Coins can cost thousands of dollars Potential for fraud in an unregulated market Self-education is key to successfully navigating the world of collectible coins as an investment.

Damage can occur in many ways, including wiping coins, handling them too much, or breathing on them. If possible, buy coins and coin sets in their original cases or capsules. You can purchase sets from mints in plastic cases specially designed to protect the coins. You can also buy single coins in capsules nested inside a folder or box. Alternatively, you can stock up on small cardboard or plastic holders, tubes, sleeves, or albums. Avoid using cardboard that contains acid or plastic with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) for storage, as these substances can damage your coins. When handling your coins, wear soft cotton gloves, keep the edges of the coin between your forefinger and thumb, and hold your coins over a soft cloth or pad in case you drop them. Resist the temptation to polish your coins – you could damage the surface. If you need to wash off dirt, use mild soap and water, and pat your coins dry with a soft cloth. Avoid rubbing. Once they’re in the proper casing, store your coins somewhere cool, dark, and dry to minimize changes in temperature and humidity. To keep your collection secure, consider taking out a bank safety deposit box or storing your coins in a safe at home. Start Your Coin Collection Today Now that you know more about coin collecting as an investment, you might be ready to try it. Interesting and having fun are important aspects of coin collecting, but so is educating yourself and gaining experience before diving in too deep. Once you’ve done your homework, you can find your niche for collecting and begin diversifying your investment portfolio with coins. Frequently Asked Questions Q Is it worth keeping coin collections? 1 Is it worth keeping coin collections? asked 2025-10-27 Sarah Edwards A 1 Yes, keeping coin collections can be worth it—historical coins, rare editions, or those in excellent condition can appreciate over time. They also offer educational and sentimental value, and can serve as a tangible, long-term investment. Answer Link answered 2025-10-27 Benzinga Q Is coin collecting still profitable? 1 Is coin collecting still profitable? asked 2025-10-27 Sarah Edwards A 1 Yes, coin collecting can still be profitable, but it comes with important caveats. The collectible-coin market is growing (a reported CAGR of about 10.5% through 2032) which suggests potential upside. On the flip side, values are very dependent on rarity, condition, demand, and market timing — and they don’t always move in lockstep with bullion. So if you approach coin collecting as a pleasure-first hobby with investment as a possible bonus, you’re in much better shape. Answer Link answered 2025-10-27 Benzinga Q What is the best coin to collect? 1 What is the best coin to collect? asked 2025-10-27 Sarah Edwards A 1 The best coins to collect are typically rare, historically significant, or limited-mintage coins. Popular choices include pre-1933 U.S. gold coins, Morgan and Peace silver dollars, and proof and mint error coins, among others.

Why Age Defines the Price of Protection When it comes to life insurance, age isn’t just a number — it’s the foundation of how insurers calculate risk. The younger and healthier you are, the lower your rates. As you age, the cost of coverage increases because the statistical likelihood of health issues or mortality rises. Yet most people don’t realize just how significant those differences can be. A 30-year-old might pay less than half what a 50-year-old pays for the same policy. Understanding how life insurance rates evolve by age helps you plan smarter, purchase earlier, and secure the right level of protection without overpaying. This guide breaks down life insurance rates by decade, explores why premiums change, and offers practical advice for locking in the most value at every stage of life. Table of contents [Show] Why Age Defines the Price of Protection How Life Insurance Rates Are Determined Average Life Insurance Rates by Age (Term Life Example) In Your 20s: The Cheapest Time to Buy Coverage In Your 30s: Balancing Family, Mortgage, and Affordability In Your 40s: Rates Begin to Climb In Your 50s: Health Becomes the Key Factor In Your 60s: Focus on Legacy and Estate Planning In Your 70s and Beyond: Specialized Options The Impact of Health and Lifestyle Across All Ages How Gender Influences Life Insurance Rates Term vs. Whole Life: How Age Affects Each The Hidden Cost of Waiting How to Lower Life Insurance Costs at Any Age 1. Shop Across Multiple Carriers 2. Get a Medical Exam (If Healthy) 3. Lock in a Longer Term 4. Bundle With Other Policies 5. Maintain Healthy Habits 6. Avoid Coverage You Don’t Need Planning Life Insurance Around Milestones How Inflation and Interest Rates Affect Policy Pricing The Role of Conversion and Renewal Options The Long-Term ROI of Buying Early Buy With Purpose, Not Panic How Life Insurance Rates Are Determined Before looking at age brackets, it’s important to understand the factors that drive your premium. While age is the most influential, insurers use a broader risk profile that includes: Health: Blood pressure, cholesterol, BMI, and family medical history. Lifestyle: Smoking, alcohol use, and risky activities. Policy type: Term life (temporary coverage) vs. whole life (permanent protection). Coverage amount: The higher the death benefit, the higher the premium. Gender: Statistically, women live longer, leading to slightly lower rates. Occupation: High-risk jobs may carry surcharges. Among all these, age remains the simplest and most universal predictor of cost — because it directly correlates with expected life span. Average Life Insurance Rates by Age (Term Life Example) The table below shows approximate monthly premiums for a healthy, non-smoking individual buying a 20-year term policy worth $500,000: AgeMale (Approx.)Female (Approx.)25$20$1730$22$1935$25$2240$34$2845$52$4250$80$6355$130$9860$210$16565$360$280 These numbers represent broad industry averages. Actual rates vary by provider, state, and health profile. The pattern is clear — premiums roughly double every 10 years after age 40. That’s why locking in a policy early can save thousands over the term’s lifespan. In Your 20s: The Cheapest Time to Buy Coverage Summary: Buying life insurance in your 20s locks in the lowest possible rates and gives you flexibility for future needs. At this stage, most people are just starting careers, paying off student loans, or planning families. Even if you don’t have dependents yet, a term life policy can protect future goals and debts — often for under $20 a month. Why rates are lowest: Strong health and long life expectancy reduce insurer risk. Few or no pre-existing conditions. Option to lock rates for 20–30 years while young. Strategic tip:Purchase a convertible term policy. It allows you to switch to permanent life insurance later without new health exams — a valuable feature if your health changes. In Your 30s: Balancing Family, Mortgage, and Affordability Summary: Your 30s are the sweet spot — still affordable, but tied to major financial commitments like a home or children. This is the decade when most people finally purchase life insurance. You’re earning more, building assets, and protecting a growing family. Premiums rise only slightly from your 20s, but coverage needs typically increase. Typical profile: Married or partnered with dependents. Mortgage and other long-term debts. Desire to maintain family lifestyle if income stops. Smart approach: Choose a 20- or 30-year term that lasts through your children’s college years. Consider adding a spousal rider for joint coverage. Review policies every few years to ensure your coverage keeps up with inflation and income. A healthy 35-year-old might still pay only around $25 per month for $500,000 in term coverage — a small price for peace of mind. In Your 40s: Rates Begin to Climb Summary: Your 40s mark a turning point where rates begin to climb steadily, but coverage remains attainable. By this age, life’s complexity often peaks — teenage children, mortgage balances, business responsibilities, and aging parents. The financial stakes are higher, but so are the premiums. Average monthly cost (healthy, non-smoker): $34 for males $28 for females What’s changing: Health screenings may uncover early conditions (cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.). Lifestyle factors begin influencing underwriting more heavily. Coverage terms shorten — many insurers cap term policies at 20 years. Smart strategy: Get medical exams early to prove good health. Combine term and permanent life if you need both affordability and lifelong protection. Lock in before age 45 — the five-year window where premiums accelerate fastest. If you delay until 50, expect to pay roughly double the 40-year-old rate for the same coverage. In Your 50s: Health Becomes the Key Factor Summary: Life insurance in your 50s is still available but far more expensive. Good health dramatically improves outcomes. At this age, insurers focus heavily on health metrics — especially heart function, cholesterol, diabetes risk, and lifestyle stability. Those with clean medical histories can still find reasonable term policies, but anyone with conditions may face exclusions or higher premiums. Average monthly cost (healthy, non-smoker): $80 for males $63 for females Common coverage goals: Paying off remaining mortgage debt. Protecting income until retirement. Funding legacy or final expenses. Tips to reduce cost: Opt for shorter-term policies (10–15 years) if you only need transitional coverage. Consider guaranteed universal life for long-term affordability. If you have group life insurance through an employer, supplement with an individual plan before retiring. For those with pre-existing conditions, a simplified issue policy (no medical exam) might be an alternative — though it carries smaller death benefits. In Your 60s: Focus on Legacy and Estate Planning Summary: In your 60s, life insurance shifts from income replacement to legacy protection and estate management. At this stage, term policies become expensive, and eligibility may narrow. Many individuals transition to whole life or final expense insurance, emphasizing guaranteed death benefits and cash value accumulation. Average monthly cost (healthy, non-smoker): $210 for males $165 for females Key considerations: Term coverage may expire near retirement — review renewal options early. Permanent insurance provides lifetime protection and estate liquidity. Premiums can be offset by downsizing coverage amounts ($100k–$250k). Practical steps: Reassess total financial picture — debts, income, legacy goals. Consider using life insurance for tax-efficient inheritance or charitable giving. Explore guaranteed issue whole life if denied elsewhere. The decision becomes less about price and more about strategic financial planning. In Your 70s and Beyond: Specialized Options Summary: Once you reach your 70s, traditional term policies become scarce, but specialized products can still serve key purposes. Most insurers cap new term coverage around age 75. Whole life or final expense policies (typically $10k–$50k coverage) become the primary options for managing burial costs, debts, or small inheritances. Expect premiums of: $300–$600 monthly for $250,000 coverage Or $50–$150 monthly for $25,000–$50,000 final expense policies Why still consider coverage: To relieve heirs of financial burdens. To equalize inheritance among children. To cover estate taxes or medical bills. Even at this stage, maintaining or adding coverage can provide emotional and financial relief for families — provided it fits within your budget and long-term plans. The Impact of Health and Lifestyle Across All Ages While age sets the baseline, lifestyle determines the multiplier. Two individuals of the same age can have dramatically different premiums depending on their health and habits. Key differentiators include: Smoking: Increases premiums by 2–3x at every age bracket. BMI: Obesity or underweight status affects cardiovascular risk ratings. Chronic conditions: Diabetes, heart disease, and high cholesterol trigger surcharges. Occupation: Jobs with physical or environmental risks influence underwriting. Driving record: DUIs or repeated violations raise concerns about overall risk tolerance. Even modest lifestyle improvements — quitting smoking, losing weight, or improving bloodwork — can lower your rate category from “Standard” to “Preferred,” cutting premiums by 20–40%. How Gender Influences Life Insurance Rates Statistically, women live longer — often by five years or more — and that translates to lower premiums. For the same policy: A 40-year-old woman might pay 15–20% less than a 40-year-old man. The gap narrows in later decades as risk factors even out. However, coverage amounts and priorities can differ. Men often buy larger policies for income replacement, while women may choose flexible or permanent coverage for estate and caregiving purposes. Term vs. Whole Life: How Age Affects Each Term Life Insurance Best for younger buyers seeking affordable protection. Provides coverage for 10–30 years. Rates are lowest under age 40. Whole Life Insurance Offers lifelong protection and builds cash value. Suitable for older buyers prioritizing estate planning. Premiums remain fixed but start higher. As you age, term insurance becomes less accessible, while whole life becomes the practical alternative for long-term financial control. Blended strategies — such as layering a smaller term policy over a base whole life plan — often provide the best balance of affordability and permanence. The Hidden Cost of Waiting One of the most common mistakes is delaying the purchase of life insurance under the assumption that it can be “handled later.” Each year of delay increases your lifetime cost. Consider two healthy non-smokers buying a $500,000, 20-year term policy: Age PurchasedMonthly PremiumTotal Cost Over 20 Years30$22$5,28040$34$8,16050$80$19,200 The 50-year-old pays over three times more for identical coverage — a clear demonstration of how timing outweighs most other variables. How to Lower Life Insurance Costs at Any Age Regardless of when you buy, a few strategic moves can help secure better pricing and terms. 1. Shop Across Multiple Carriers Each insurer uses unique underwriting criteria. Comparing quotes from at least three to five providers can yield significant savings. 2. Get a Medical Exam (If Healthy) Full underwriting often produces lower rates than simplified or guaranteed policies because you provide proof of health. 3. Lock in a Longer Term A 30-year term at 30 years old can save money long-term versus renewing shorter policies later at older ages. 4. Bundle With Other Policies Some insurers offer multi-policy discounts when combining life, auto, or home insurance. 5. Maintain Healthy Habits Regular exercise, routine checkups, and non-smoking status pay off directly in lower premiums. 6. Avoid Coverage You Don’t Need Buying excessive coverage “just in case” inflates cost. Match your policy amount to actual financial obligations. Planning Life Insurance Around Milestones Instead of viewing life insurance as a single decision, think of it as a timeline that evolves with your life milestones: Life StageCommon Coverage GoalPolicy TypeTypical TermEarly CareerProtect co-signers or debtsTerm20–30 yearsMarriageIncome replacementTerm + Riders20–30 yearsParenthoodSupport dependentsTerm20–25 yearsMidlifeMortgage and education coverageTerm or Whole15–20 yearsPre-RetirementEstate or legacy planningWholeLifetimeRetirementFinal expensesWhole / Final ExpenseLifetime This approach ensures that your protection evolves as responsibilities change — keeping premiums efficient without sacrificing security. How Inflation and Interest Rates Affect Policy Pricing Beyond age, economic conditions can influence premiums indirectly. When interest rates rise, insurers earn more on their investment portfolios, sometimes leading to lower premium growth. Conversely, prolonged low-rate environments can push costs slightly higher. Inflation also matters: coverage amounts that seemed substantial 20 years ago may not meet today’s needs. A $250,000 policy purchased in 2005 has the equivalent purchasing power of roughly $160,000 today. Regularly reassessing your policy every 5–10 years ensures you stay properly covered relative to cost of living changes. The Role of Conversion and Renewal Options For term policies, conversion privileges allow you to switch to permanent coverage later — typically before age 65 — without new health exams. This feature is invaluable if your health changes after purchase. Renewal clauses, meanwhile, let you extend coverage after the term ends, but usually at higher premiums. Choosing a policy with both options adds flexibility as life evolves. The Long-Term ROI of Buying Early Life insurance isn’t an investment in the traditional sense, but it offers financial leverage. A few thousand dollars in total premiums can yield hundreds of thousands in guaranteed benefits. Buying early maximizes that leverage: Lower premiums mean higher net return on every dollar spent. Health-based rate locks can’t be replicated later. The cash-value component (in whole life) has longer to compound. For those building a long-term financial plan, early insurance purchase functions as both risk protection and wealth preservation tool. Buy With Purpose, Not Panic Understanding life insurance rates by age empowers you to make deliberate, informed choices — not reactive ones. The right time to buy isn’t when you’re older and “need it,” but when you’re healthy enough to afford more coverage for less. In your 20s–30s: lock in long, low rates. In your 40s–50s: balance coverage and affordability. In your 60s+: focus on legacy, estate, and liquidity. Every decade offers a strategic entry point — but the sooner you act, the more value you capture. Life insurance isn’t just about leaving money behind; it’s about creating financial stability that lives alongside you.

Progressive is one of the most recognizable insurance brands in the United States, known primarily for its auto coverage and national advertising presence. However, renters insurance represents a smaller yet critical segment of its business — one that appeals to tenants seeking convenience, affordability, and digital accessibility. This review examines the structure, cost, performance, and service reputation of Progressive’s renters insurance offering as it stands in 2025. It provides a factual, research-based overview of what the company delivers, how it compares to competitors, and which renters will benefit most from choosing Progressive over other carriers.

Progressive Overview: Financial Strength and Business Model Progressive Corporation, headquartered in Mayfield Village, Ohio, ranks among the largest property and casualty insurers in the U.S. With an A+ (Superior) rating for financial strength from AM Best and consistent multi-billion-dollar annual revenues, the company demonstrates a stable financial foundation for paying claims. However, the structure of Progressive’s renters insurance product is worth clarifying. Progressive operates as a broker and underwriter hybrid — while it issues many policies directly, some renters insurance policies are underwritten by partner companies (such as third-party affiliates within its insurance group). This model allows Progressive to serve a broad range of customers nationally but can lead to variations in customer experience, particularly in claims handling and regional service support. This distinction matters because it explains why customer satisfaction data for Progressive’s renters insurance differs across states — a pattern confirmed in aggregated consumer reviews and regional complaint ratios. Core Coverages: What Progressive Renters Insurance Includes 1. Personal Property Coverage This covers the tenant’s belongings against covered perils such as theft, fire, smoke damage, vandalism, and certain types of water damage. The policy is written on a named peril basis, meaning only events specifically listed in the contract are covered. Progressive’s coverage reimburses the cost to repair or replace items up to the selected limit. Policyholders can choose between: Actual Cash Value (ACV): Depreciated value of items. Replacement Cost Value (RCV): Full replacement value without depreciation. RCV coverage carries a higher premium but provides stronger protection — an option Progressive allows customers to select during the quoting process. 2. Personal Liability Coverage This covers bodily injury or property damage that the renter causes to others, either within the rented property or elsewhere. Standard liability limits typically begin at $100,000 and can be increased, in increments, depending on underwriting approval and local regulation. 3. Loss of Use (Additional Living Expenses) If a covered peril makes the rental unit uninhabitable, this portion reimburses the insured for temporary housing, food, and transportation costs. 4. Medical Payments to Others This coverage pays small medical expenses for injuries to guests on the property, even when the insured isn’t legally responsible. Standard limits are usually $1,000–$5,000. Optional and Add-On Coverages Progressive provides multiple add-ons to help tailor the policy: Scheduled Personal Property (SPP): Allows customers to insure specific valuables — jewelry, watches, fine art, collectibles — beyond standard sub-limits. Water Backup and Sewer Overflow: Offers coverage for property damage caused by water backing up through drains or sump pumps — an exclusion in standard renters policies. Identity Theft Protection: Some states offer optional ID recovery services and expense reimbursement as a rider. Personal Injury Endorsement: Extends liability to cover libel, slander, or defamation claims in states where available. Pet Damage Liability: In certain jurisdictions, Progressive offers pet liability protection if an animal injures someone — distinct from pet insurance, but useful for renters with pets subject to landlord requirements. Coverage Limits and Deductible Structure Progressive’s personal property coverage typically ranges from $20,000 to $100,000, depending on state minimums and selected options. Deductibles usually fall between $250 and $1,000, with flexibility to raise or lower based on premium preference. Customers can increase liability coverage up to $500,000 in many states, though higher limits often require additional underwriting review. Loss-of-use coverage generally provides 20–30% of the personal property limit, which aligns with industry norms. Policy Accessibility and Technology One of Progressive’s defining strengths is its digital infrastructure. The quoting process is streamlined, taking an average of under 5 minutes to complete. Users can view premiums, adjust limits, and add endorsements instantly. Through the Progressive mobile app, policyholders can: Access policy documents. Manage billing. File or track claims (where handled in-house). Update contact or payment details. This technology-forward model benefits renters seeking convenience over traditional agent interaction. It also positions Progressive competitively against newer digital-first insurers targeting younger demographics. Pricing and Premium Insights Renters insurance remains one of the most affordable types of personal coverage, and Progressive positions itself near the center of the market on price. Based on aggregated pricing data for 2024–2025 across multiple consumer review sources and quoted examples: Average premium for a $30,000 property limit and $100,000 liability coverage: Typically falls between $180 and $250 annually (approximately $15–$21 per month). Higher coverage limits ($50,000 property / $300,000 liability): Average premiums range $220–$310 annually depending on location, deductible, and credit tier. Bundled customers (renters + auto): Reported savings average between 10–15%, depending on state regulation and combined policy value. Premiums are primarily influenced by: State and city risk data (fire, theft, weather). Building construction type (frame vs. masonry). Presence of safety features (sprinklers, alarms). Credit-based insurance scores. Claims history. While Progressive’s renters pricing is competitive, it rarely ranks as the lowest; its advantage lies in bundled discounts and ease of integration with existing Progressive policies, not undercutting competitors on standalone pricing. Discount Programs and Savings Opportunities Progressive’s renters insurance offers a range of discounts that can substantially reduce costs when stacked: Multi-Policy Discount (Bundling): The most substantial savings apply when combining renters with auto or motorcycle coverage. Pay-in-Full Discount: Paying the full premium upfront instead of monthly installments typically reduces total cost by 5–10%. Paperless and AutoPay: Opting for electronic documents and automatic billing provides modest recurring savings and simplifies account management. Quote in Advance Discount: Customers who secure a policy several days before the effective date qualify for reduced premiums in many states. Home Safety Features: Smoke detectors, fire extinguishers, and monitored alarms may trigger minor discounts. Although these programs mirror industry norms, Progressive’s bundle incentives are among the most consistent nationwide. Claims Handling and Service Performance Claims Process Overview Policyholders can file claims via: The Progressive mobile app. The company’s claims hotline (24/7 availability). Independent agents (if policy originated through an agent channel). In straightforward losses — such as theft or water damage — claims are typically processed within a few business days, provided documentation (receipts, photos) is available. Service Quality Indicators Third-party customer satisfaction surveys indicate mixed results. Progressive performs above average in claims availability and online experience, but below average in claim resolution satisfaction compared to insurers specializing in property lines. Common consumer themes include: Smooth policy setup and billing. Frustration over delays or lack of communication during claims escalation. Variability between states and underwriting partners. This inconsistency stems partly from Progressive’s hybrid underwriting structure, where claims may be handled by different entities. Still, Progressive’s financial stability and digital transparency remain reassuring strengths for policyholders concerned about solvency and documentation. Customer Satisfaction and Reputation Metrics Progressive maintains strong brand awareness and trust among U.S. consumers but holds average ratings for renters insurance service satisfaction. Data from large consumer research firms reveal: Overall renters insurance satisfaction scores hover in the mid-range compared to competitors. Positive ratings emphasize ease of purchase, affordable cost, and bundling convenience. Negative feedback centers on claims responsiveness and agent communication gaps. Progressive’s customer experience strategy prioritizes digital convenience over traditional, high-touch service. For tech-savvy renters, this trade-off feels acceptable. For those who prefer dedicated agent guidance during claims, the experience can feel impersonal. Financial Strength and Industry Standing Progressive’s A+ (Superior) rating from AM Best reflects a strong capital position and low risk of claim non-payment. Additionally: It ranks among the top five U.S. property and casualty insurers by market share. It consistently reports multi-billion-dollar net income and substantial surplus reserves. These fundamentals assure policyholders that, despite service variation, Progressive has the financial resources to handle catastrophic or high-volume claims events. Comparative Analysis: Progressive vs. Industry Peers Coverage Breadth Progressive’s renters insurance includes all essential protections and allows optional add-ons, matching industry leaders like State Farm, Allstate, and Liberty Mutual. However, specialized endorsements are fewer in number. Pricing Competitiveness Progressive’s pricing aligns closely with national averages — rarely cheapest, rarely highest. Its most compelling advantage is bundle pricing efficiency for customers already insured through Progressive. Claims Reputation Competitors focused on homeowners or property coverage (e.g., Amica, Erie) tend to score higher on claims satisfaction. Progressive’s mixed service ratings reflect its diversified product portfolio — renters insurance isn’t its flagship line. Technology and Ease of Use Here, Progressive leads. Its web quoting, mobile app, and account management tools consistently rank among the best in the insurance industry. Strengths Summary Financial Reliability: Backed by superior credit ratings and strong capitalization, Progressive is a secure choice. Ease of Purchase and Management: Online quoting, binding, and policy management are seamless and fast. Bundling Efficiency: Progressive’s bundling strategy provides tangible, recurring cost savings. Transparent Digital Claims Filing: Claim initiation and documentation are accessible from anywhere. Nationwide Availability: Consistent presence across nearly all U.S. states. Limitations Summary Inconsistent Claims Experience: Variability in adjuster communication and processing speed depending on state. Limited Specialty Endorsements: Fewer options for high-value items or rare collectibles compared to niche insurers. Average Service Scores: Progressive’s renters division lacks the personal engagement that competitors like Amica or Country Financial offer. Third-Party Underwriting Variance: Depending on region, some renters policies are serviced by partner insurers, not Progressive itself. Ideal Customer Profile Progressive’s renters insurance is best suited for: Standard apartment or condominium tenants seeking affordable, efficient coverage. Auto policyholders already with Progressive who can maximize bundle discounts. Digitally inclined customers who prefer self-service over agent communication. Less ideal for: Renters with extensive high-value property or specific collectible items. Customers who prioritize personalized, local claims assistance. Tenants in high-risk regions requiring niche endorsements like flood or earthquake coverage. How Progressive’s Renters Policy Fits Broader Risk Planning For renters with broader Progressive portfolios, adding renters insurance provides several strategic benefits: Cross-Policy Coordination: Claims involving auto and renters (e.g., theft from a vehicle near home) can be handled within the same ecosystem. Umbrella Policy Compatibility: Renters who purchase umbrella liability coverage benefit from Progressive’s unified policy structure. Portfolio Simplification: Managing multiple policies within one digital platform reduces administrative friction and potential billing confusion. These structural efficiencies create tangible value for long-term Progressive clients seeking consolidated risk management. Strategic Considerations Before Purchasing Before finalizing a Progressive renters policy, assess these factors: State-specific exclusions: Some perils (earthquake, flood) require separate endorsements or standalone policies. Sub-limit clarity: Verify limits on jewelry, electronics, and specialty goods. Claims documentation expectations: Keep a photographic inventory of property. Discount eligibility: Apply all applicable multi-policy, pay-in-full, and security system discounts during quoting. Policy renewal terms: Monitor annual renewal adjustments — Progressive periodically recalculates premiums based on inflation and claims ratios. Regularly reviewing coverage ensures alignment with property value and inflation trends. Long-Term Value and Reputation Outlook Progressive’s renters product reflects the company’s overall trajectory: digitally optimized, cost-competitive, and financially sound. Its strongest appeal lies in simplicity and trust in a national brand rather than premium customization or boutique service. Over the next several years, Progressive is expected to continue expanding automation in claims processing, which may close the service satisfaction gap seen in earlier reviews. As artificial intelligence and predictive analytics are integrated into underwriting, pricing precision may also improve — potentially stabilizing premiums and further rewarding low-risk renters. From a strategic lens, renters who maintain consistent coverage early in tenancy and later transition to Progressive homeowners insurance (upon purchasing property) may benefit from seamless conversion options and retained policy discounts. Should You Choose Progressive Renters Insurance? Progressive delivers a dependable, nationally available renters insurance policy backed by one of the strongest financial structures in the industry. It is not the absolute cheapest option, nor the most customizable, but it succeeds in providing solid, predictable coverage at a fair price point. The Bottom Line: Financial stability: Excellent. Coverage breadth: Comprehensive but not specialized. Pricing: Competitive, especially for bundled customers. Digital experience: Industry-leading. Claims satisfaction: Mixed, but improving with digital adoption. For tenants prioritizing affordability, convenience, and national reliability — especially those already holding Progressive auto or motorcycle coverage — this policy represents a practical and efficient choice. Those requiring elevated service attention or niche coverage (e.g., rare valuables, high-risk zones) should compare against Amica, State Farm, or specialized property insurers. Ultimately, Progressive’s renters insurance embodies the company’s brand identity: straightforward, modern, and built for everyday customers who value function over flair. It is a strong fit for most renters — provided expectations are set accurately for service depth versus cost efficiency.

With more than 44,000 locations in over 100 countries, McDonald’s Corp’s (NYSE: MCD) franchising model has helped it expand internationally, and the company posted surprisingly good Q2 results during an industry downturn. In this article, we’ll look at MCD’s latest share price, Wall Street sentiment, multiyear price forecasts, and the key factors that are playing a critical role in the company’s path going forward. MCD Chart by TradingView Table of contents [Show] Current Stock Overview Quick Snapshot Table of Predictions & Methodology for Forecasting Bull & Bear Case Stock Price Prediction for 2025 Stock Price Prediction for 2026 Stock Price Prediction for 2030 Investment Considerations Frequently Asked Questions Current Stock Overview Market Cap: $219.36 billion Trailing P/E Ratio: 25.70 Forward P/E Ratio: 22.62 1-Year Return: 3% 2025 YTD: 6% McDonald’s is trading around $307 per share as of October, 2025. The stock hasn’t moved much overall in the past year, trading between a low of about $280 and a high near $321, while shares are priced close to their 52-week average. The company delivered 3.8% year-over-year comparable sales growth in Q2, which shows how existing restaurants are performing, instead of letting new restaurant openings dictate the financial picture. It also comes at a time when overall foot traffic to fast food restaurants dropped by 1.5% year-over-year in September, according to research firm Black Box Intelligence. McDonald’s revenue as a whole increased by 5% year-over-year. McDonald’s continues to grow rapidly and its franchising model translates into higher profits, helping the company close out Q2 with a 33% net profit margin. Very few restaurants come anywhere close to that. Persistent inflation, however, has put lower and middle-income households in a financial pinch, and they may pull back on their restaurant spending. Younger generations are also cutting expenses, with many dining out a lot less. McDonald’s has been one of the few winning restaurant brands during this cycle, but that could change as people’s wallets get tighter. MCD has a consensus Buy rating from 28 analysts, according to Benzinga. The average price target is $327 per share, which suggests a slight upside from current levels. The highest price target is $381, and the lowest is $260. The three most recent ratings suggest a near-term average target of $352, suggesting a 19% upside. Quick Snapshot Table of Predictions & Methodology for Forecasting Bull & Bear Case McDonald’s has performed better than most fast food restaurants during this challenging economic cycle, but there are macros issues to monitor. Bull Case Comparable sales are up year-over-year, while some competitors have declining year-over-year comparable sales due to economic headwinds McDonald’s franchise model results in higher profit margins and has turned it into the most recognizable fast food restaurant chain The company is achieving elevated growth in international markets Bear Case Lower- and middle-class consumers are pulling back on dining and other expenses, which can translate into lower revenue growth in future quarters Foot traffic to fast food restaurants dropped by 1.5% in September, demonstrating growth issues in the industry that may impact McDonald’s in the future McDonald’s has reported modest revenue growth, which may limit its future upside Stock Price Prediction for 2025 CoinCodex has a moderate price range for MCD stock in 2025. The highest target implies a modest gain, while the lowest suggests a modest downside. The midpoint presents a slight downside from current levels. Macroeconomic headwinds can pressure the company’s revenue growth, and that could push the stock closer to the lower end of the forecast. Stock Price Prediction for 2026 The range gets wider for MCD stock in 2026, based on CoinCodex’s projections. The average price target suggests MCD stock will stay flat, with big gains at the high end and moderate losses on the low. MCD stock can rally if macroeconomic challenges become less impactful, prompting lower- and middle-class households to visit its restaurants more frequently. Stock Price Prediction for 2030 CoinCodex presents an optimistic scenario for McDonald’s stock in 2030. Positive consumer sentiment and international expansion can help MCD stock realize these forecasts. Even the lowest price target presents a solid upside from current levels. Investment Considerations McDonald’s is the clear leader in the fast food industry, and its franchise model results in attractive profit margins. Domestic and international growth are up, while rivals are struggling, but macroeconomic conditions may eventually show up in future earnings results. MCD stock may be suitable for value investors who are approaching retirement and want a relatively low-volatility stock that has a high dividend yield. Frequently Asked Questions Q Is MCD stock a good long-term investment? 1 Is MCD stock a good long-term investment? asked 2025-10-27 Marc Guberti A 1 MCD stock may be a good long-term investment due to its commanding presence in the fast food restaurant scene and high profit margins.

The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE: PG) has been a consumer goods staple for almost 200 years, weathering various economic cycles with some of the world’s top brands under its umbrella. Growth has been slow in recent quarters, however, and that may pressure the stock’s near-term valuation. In this article, we’ll look at PG’s latest share price, Wall Street sentiment, multiyear price forecasts, and the key factors that are playing a critical role in the company’s path going forward. PG Chart by TradingView Table of contents [Show] Current Stock Overview Quick Snapshot Table of Predictions & Methodology for Forecasting Bull & Bear Case Stock Price Prediction for 2025 Stock Price Prediction for 2026 Stock Price Prediction for 2030 Investment Considerations Frequently Asked Questions Current Stock Overview Market Cap: $357 billion Trailing P/E Ratio: 23.36 Forward P/E Ratio: 21.74 1-Year Return: -9% 2025 YTD: -9% Shares of Procter & Gamble are currently trading around $153 after sliding 9% both year-to-date and over the last 52 weeks. A 2.8% dividend yield helps cushion the losses, but the stock has still been underperforming the S&P 500. Procter & Gamble has many top-tier household brands under its corporate umbrella, including Pampers, Tide, Gillette and Crest. That gives it a large market share and also makes the stock more resilient during economic downturns. Lately, though, the company has had trouble innovating beyond its current brand mix. Procter & Gamble only delivered 2% year-over-year net sales growth in Q4, with net sales flat across fiscal 2025. These low growth rates put more pressure on PG’s P/E ratio, which is higher than more than 60% of consumer packaged goods companies, indicating that investors may see its rivals as better values. On the plus side, Procter & Gamble’s net profit margin has been growing, but that can change if private-label brands continue offering product discounts, which could force the company into a race to the bottom. Even with pricing pressure, its dividend looks solid, having gone up for 69 consecutive years, making Procter & Gamble a “Dividend King,” which is a company that has raised its payout for at least 50 years in a row. PG has a consensus Hold rating from 26 analysts, according to Benzinga. The average price target is $176.72 per share, which suggests a moderate upside from current levels. The highest price target is $209, and the lowest is $153. The three most recent ratings suggest a near-term average target of $166.67, suggesting a 9% upside. Quick Snapshot Table of Predictions & Methodology for Forecasting Bull & Bear Case Procter & Gamble has a long history of riding out the economy’s ups and downs, but sales have slowed, and the stock may appear overvalued. Bull Case PG is resilient during economic downturns and has a long history, making it a potential safe haven amid uncertainty Procter & Gamble has some of the most recognized consumer goods brands, which makes it hard for competitors to challenge its dominance. Net profit margins are rising Bear Case Sales growth has been slow in recent quarters PG stock has a higher P/E ratio than most of its peers Private-label brands can charge lower prices, which may limit Procter & Gamble’s future growth opportunities Stock Price Prediction for 2025 CoinCodex projects very little price movement for PG stock for the rest of the year. Even the minimum and maximum price targets represent minimal change. The company isn’t posting high growth numbers, but it’s not as though Procter & Gamble is losing ground either. These forecasts indicate that many investors are waiting on the sidelines. Stock Price Prediction for 2026 CoinCodex projects a slight dip in PG stock’s value next year. The drops don’t indicate material issues with the company, but pricing pressure from private-label brands and flat sales growth may pressure the stock’s valuation and financials. Stock Price Prediction for 2030 CoinCodex projects a modest upside for PG stock in 2030. The company’s vast amount of brands gives it a sizable market share, and if those names continue to grow, shares may hit these forecasts. Procter & Gamble’s history of enduring various economic cycles may also make the stock more attractive amid uncertainty. Investment Considerations Procter & Gamble has a storied history and an unrivaled dividend streak. Its legacy brands are some of the biggest in the industry, but it still faces pricing pressure from private labels. The company also suffers from slow growth rates, which can put more pressure on its stock’s valuation. PG stock makes the most sense for value investors who want high yields and relatively low volatility. Frequently Asked Questions Q Is PG stock a good long-term investment? 1 Is PG stock a good long-term investment? asked 2025-10-27 Marc Guberti A 1 PG stock may be a good long-term investment due to its strong presence in the consumer goods market.

They’re the second-most preferred type of investment behind retirement accounts, which themselves held 79% of plan contributions in equities last year, according to Vanguard’s “How America Saves 2025” study. There are other options, though, to invest without buying stocks. In fact, diversifying your portfolio with reliable alternatives can help reduce your overall risk. Here are five to consider as investments beyond the stock market. Table of contents [Show] 5 Top Investments Outside the Stock Market 1. Real Estate Investments 2. Bonds and Fixed Income 3. Alternative Investments (Private Equity, Hedge Funds, Commodities) 4. Peer-to-Peer Lending and Private Credit 5. Startups and Crowdfunding Building Wealth Beyond Stocks Frequently Asked Questions 5 Top Investments Outside the Stock Market Do you fear investing in assets other than stocks? There are several alternatives to stock investing that could fit your goals, financial situation and risk tolerance. Here are the top 5 ways you can invest without buying stocks. 1. Real Estate Investments Historically, real estate has been a foundational investment to build wealth because it can provide steady cash flow and hedge against inflation. When the prices of consumer goods rise, rents typically increase too. You can buy residential or commercial investment properties directly. For residential, think single-family homes that you can rent short or long term, or a duplex or triplex to rent long term. Commercial properties could include an apartment complex, office building or shopping center. Either approach could deliver passive income from rent revenue as well as appreciation. More budget-friendly approaches to real estate investing include buying shares of a real estate investment trust (REIT) or joining others to buy shares of a property. A REIT is a company that owns and operates residential and commercial properties that generate income. It functions much like a stock, and you get paid a dividend periodically without having to worry about hands-on property management. Through a fractional real estate investing platform, you can join multiple buyers in owning an equal portion of a property, contributing proportionally to property management and earning rental income and appreciation. 2. Bonds and Fixed Income Bonds and other fixed-income products can generate stable and predictable income through scheduled interest payments and a return of your principal, appealing to conservative investors, retirees, and those who prioritize income generation and capital preservation over growth. Fixed-income investments can include government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and certificates of deposit (CDs). Companies and governments issue bonds as a promise to repay money they borrow to pay for projects and activities. You can receive a set interest payment for a defined period with the promise of returning the principal at maturity. The U.S. Treasury issues bills, notes and bonds backed by the federal government. Local and state governments issue bonds to pay for things like roads and water systems. Corporations sell bonds to pay for operations, such as capital projects. CDs are time deposits with banks or credit unions that pay a fixed rate of interest for a specified term, typically a few months to several years. You agree not to touch the money for the term in exchange for a guaranteed return at maturity. 3. Alternative Investments (Private Equity, Hedge Funds, Commodities) In search of ways to build wealth without stocks, many investors (especially millennials and Gen Z) are skeptical that traditional markets can produce high returns or align with their values, so they’re turning to alternatives. An alternative investment isn’t an asset class. It’s a wide-ranging grouping of assets that aren’t stocks, bonds, cash or cash equivalents. That grouping includes hedge funds, private equity, venture capital, real estate, commodities, cryptocurrency, art and collectibles. Once considered available only to high-net-worth individuals and institutions, alternative investments typically present a higher barrier to entry, requiring more capital. However, online platforms that allow fractional investing have opened some alternative investments to investors with less money. While alternative investments generally come with higher risks, they also have the potential for high returns — with the added benefit of diversifying your portfolio. 4. Peer-to-Peer Lending and Private Credit Peer-to-peer leading platforms and private credit funds allow you to loan money to individuals or businesses. In return, you can get higher interest, often 8% to 10%, than is typically paid on a bond. Online platforms for peer-to-peer lending allow you to vet potential borrowers, helping to lower your risk on the unsecured loan. Private credit (loans made by non-bank lenders) often secures loans against real assets or collateral. Peer-to-peer lending is unregulated, so you bear all the risk if a borrower defaults. With private credit, you face potential illiquidity if you need to access your money quickly. 5. Startups and Crowdfunding When you invest without buying stocks, you can feed your sense of entrepreneurship and help others realize their dreams. Equity crowdfunding and angel investing are two ways you can back a startup or early-stage company. In each case, you exchange your capital for an equity stake. However, these methods differ in scale and investor type. Equity crowdfunding uses an online platform to pool small contributions — as little as $100 in some cases — from many investors, while angel investing typically involves a high-net-worth individual directly financing a startup. The benefit is the high potential upside. If the company takes off, your worth grows. But funding a startup is also high risk. Around 90% of startups fail, with 10% going under in their first year. You can use online platforms such as Wefunder, StartEngine, Republic and Fundable for equity crowdfunding, and startups can connect with angel investors at AngelList, Gust and SeedInvest. Building Wealth Beyond Stocks More than half of private-sector workers invest in retirement savings accounts tilted largely toward investing in equities, and many investors prefer putting their money in the stock market. However, you don’t need to follow the crowd and limit your investing. By focusing on stocks and funds based on stocks, you could be missing out on the power of investing to boost wealth creation, outpace inflation, prepare for retirement and move toward your financial goals. Now that you know how to invest without stocks, you may be able to reap the potential benefits of diversification, passive income and long-term growth that can come from adding multiple asset classes to your investment mix. Frequently Asked Questions Q What are the safest ways to invest without stocks? 1 What are the safest ways to invest without stocks? asked 2025-10-27 Sarah Edwards A 1 All investments carry some level of risk, but there are several low-risk investments you can consider based on your financial goals, risk tolerance and investment horizon. The range of low-risk investments includes high-yield savings accounts, certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury bonds, money market funds, corporate and municipal bonds, real estate and fixed annuities.

Consider your financial situation, risk tolerance and investment goals, then decide the allocation of each to include in your portfolio. Answer Link answered 2025-10-27 Benzinga Q Are alternative investments riskier than stocks? 1 Are alternative investments riskier than stocks? asked 2025-10-27 Sarah Edwards A 1 Alternative investments — real estate, commodities, collectibles, cryptocurrency and private equity — are generally riskier than stocks because they often have lower liquidity, less transparency, higher fees and greater complexity. However, alternative assets typically have the potential to generate higher returns.

From his books, I gathered the importance of price. No asset is ever so good if it is over pricey. Briefly I gathered it is one of the cores of his theories. And so I am not interested in gold. At least not at this moment. I would not argue that gold is a good hedge against inflation, currency debasement and geopolitical instability. In this regard, I fully agree with Mr. Ray Dalio’s view, another guru whose theories underpin my own. His book How Countries Go Broke is what I have been reading lately and I found the book really great. In my view, the best time for buying gold as an hedge is GONE. If you want to do it, probably the best time was right after COVID’s breakout, or at the latest the beginning of Ukraine war. That was what the ex-citi trader Gary Steveson had done, according to himself. Now, hovering around 4000 it is WAY TOO EXPENSIVE. There is a huge private gold reserve round the globe. In case of rapid economic downturn, you will find private gold sold into the market. This can rapidly drag down the price of spot gold. India is a country that has an investment boom, and India has a HUGH private gold reserve. Check out the quantum by yourself, and you will be amazed. In case of a market burst and massive margin calls hit retail investors, they will most likely sell household gold. I gave this narrative a name, “the Mumbai Narrative”. And the same thing can happen everywhere. Say, the Chinese have lots of private gold and those who have the wealth to protect is still stacking up, while China is having a lingering property market crisis. While I was thinking about this narrative over and over again, since a couple days ago gold price has started showing cracks. A couple hours ago it was approaching 4000. I found it particularly worrying when at the same time Bitcoin and Es’ prices are recovering, but this is another can of worms.",Natural-Heat-7010,0,7,,discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1odj08a/the_mumbai_narrative_why_not_gold_for_now/,StockMarket,,,

Sometimes I fail at that, and although I don't think this is one of those times I'll try to restate each thing you took issue with and explain what I meant. >Wow, that's a bad look and not even enough units or revenue to make a real difference. What I mean by this is it's obviously a sketchy thing to do, it's very visible, and to what end? It's not enough revenue shifting to make a huge difference for Tesla or get CyberTruck unit sales anywhere near the >10x more they thought they would sell so it just looks *terrible* and doesn't even accomplish anything. > Going from hundreds to ""perhaps thousands"" without evidence seems like a journalistic stretch though. I did not say there is no evidence of anything, I said specifically they went from factually ""hundreds"" to ""perhaps thousands"" without evidence which is a stretch. You can report anything if you put ""perhaps"" in front of it I guess - *perhaps* the cars were all filled with ketamine for Elon, probably not but hey, perhaps. >Also not to be pedantic but it would not be ""money laundering"" which is concealing illegally obtained money, it would just be corruption Here I am clarifying that on the spectrum of things one can do wrong this would be ""corruption"" and not ""money laundering"" as you suggested. Money laundering has a specific legal meaning and is always a crime. Corruption has a less specific meaning and there are many forms of corruption which are ethically and morally wrong but not illegal. For example, lobbying is a form of legal corruption in my opinion. Also, I specifically said ""which IMO is corruption"" so I don't know where you get that I ""unconditionally support"" it, it seems like you just wanted to think that so you could yell at me. Sorry, I'm not your enemy. I used to work in the defense contracting sector and one of the reasons I hated it is how corrupt / not-merit-based it is, personal connections drive so many government procurement decisions and cause incompetence to be swept under the rug and there's no regard for efficiency.",Worf_Of_Wall_St,8,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1odj6zw/tesla_reports_revenue_growth_of_12_after_two_down/nkvxzkb/,StockMarket,,,

Trump is a Semi-literate, born wealthy conman with zero work ethic, an insatiable addiction for attention and the the need to constantly grift. So he created this WWE type persona of ""billionaire business genius"" to get constant attention and to swindle people. The downside is that Trump forgot that he was doing a performance and actually believed he was his character, then became his character. He's a clown and an imbecile who paints his face orange with the vocabulary of a spoiled 15yo and the literacy/dyslexia of a SLD 12yo taking special classes near the boiler room of the school. And if Trump was trying the make deals on Craigslist? 1. If he's selling, he's gonna lie about the item, brand, usage, quality, legitimacy etc of the thing he's selling, but when the buyer shows up, he's gonna try to take the cash before the buyer notices. 2. If he's buying, he'd create 12 Craigslist accounts, flag any other accounts that might be inquiring so they get shut down. And with all of them down-Bidding the seller trump would message with a ""real offer"" that's 1/10th asking price pretending he's the only option. When the seller shows up, he's gonna offer 1/20th saying ""well, what other options do you have now?"" then try to pay with expired gift cards. The man will put 100hrs of work into ripping someone off vs 2hrs of actual work. Research what he did to the usfl so he could try to get his own NFL team.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to grant expedited reviews for data-center grid connections, according to documents reviewed by Bloomberg News. Under a draft proposed rule Wright sent to the agency, those reviews would be limited to 60 days, a seismic shift for a process that currently can drag on for years. Faster approvals would be a major boon to President Donald Trump’s artificial-intelligence ambitions. They also would help mitigate other administration moves that risked handicapping the AI boom, such as tariffs and rejections of renewable-energy initiatives. This type of rule change has been eagerly anticipated by tech and power executives in the aftermath of the FERC’s rejection of a request by Talen Energy Corp. to directly supply an Amazon.com Inc. data center from a Pennsylvania nuclear plant. But it also risks pushback from states grappling with soaring power demand from data centers, new factories and electric vehicles — and the resulting higher utility bills.",Vivid-Avocado9342,17,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1oek6dc/trump_administration_moves_to_speed_datacenter/nl2bora/,StockMarket,,,

In addition, China's invasion of Taiwan does not exist. It is just exaggerated by Western media. In particular, the US government hopes that China will attack Taiwan and let China decline like Russia. However, China's political elites are patient and wise, and the US strategy is unlikely to succeed. The Chinese government's top priority is to ensure the stability of its own regime. They are using propaganda and infiltration warfare to erode Taiwan and strengthen cultural exchanges with the Taiwanese.

If $5,000 gains are meaningless because your portfolio is $1.2m, hold. Fact is: There's quite a bit of room for that to grow. You have another earning calls December 2025, Google has not made big announcements, if they do, that call will be worth much more. However, time decay will kick in soon as well.

If you exercised now you would be burning about $400 in extrinsic value. Sell if you like the gains you have currently. Hold if you think Google has some more up in it. You are deep in the money so there isn't much extrinsic value left in your option, which means theta won't have much effect on the value of your option. Another option is to sell a contract against it thus creating a spread. This will lock in some of your profits (lower your risk) and leave some room for you to squeeze a little more out of the position. You could sell a call from 11/21 expiration at about 0.30 delta and pick up almost $500 in credit (which would cover your original debit, so you'd be riding on profits only). You can roll this month to month before the option expires and before the stock price goes above the strike to pick up more credits.

Just looking for investment ideas basically. I’d appreciate any tips or insights that people may have, I of course would do my own research into whatever recommendations people give, but I’m interested in identifying a few more stocks that have good growth potential over the next 2-4 years. Companies that I have been investing in are all pretty popular on Reddit. In no particular order they are: - Nebius (NBIS) - Coreweave (CRWV) - ASTS - Rocket Lab (RKLB) - IREN - Applied Digital (APLD) I like all of them because they offer lots of growth potential in the coming several years, but they also aren’t just some random penny stock companies, but are decently well established. This isn’t to say they don’t have the potential for the stock to tank all of a sudden, but I believe in all of these quite strongly. **TLDR:** Basically I want to know which companies you believe in the most for growth and capital gains over the next several years",21_Points,137,238,,discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1of19x8/what_is_your_highest_conviction_growth_stock/,StockMarket,,,

nleev1f,reddit_comment,2025-10-26 00:27:18+00:00,2025-10-28 12:50:53+00:00,,"and who do you think finances PE? Back pre GFC the bank I worked for lent money to check cashing places and basically financed the entire operation. Think about how nuts that is. The check cashing place borrowed from the bank at libor plus 2%. They lent to their customers at some insane rate. I bet banks are highly exposed directly to PE and indirectly through a pile of various ways. You lend a bunch of money to a commercial real estate llc that owns a single building valued at some crazy number. Is all that money used for purchasing the building? Nope. Usually a chunk goes into the pocket of the developer who uses it for other stuff.... like financing PE. No one really knows the exposure and they will just have to see how much gets destroyed from this. At some point the spread of destruction peters out and comes to a halt, but until then banks are likely cutting back from additional risk exposure.

Retail has given these companies $1b in cash to invest/R&D with, which will drive things pretty fast and far. US Gov't contracts will drive them to create useful applications for military, then roll these applications out to the broader market. It's currently better than a non-zero chance right now that buying quantum companies turns them into the next NVDA. For that crazy level of reward, the risk of money is worth it, and the believers will likely hold. My own 2 cents is the following: Retail that wanted to take a profit did so over the last two weeks. The others are longer-term in the game. The Martin Shkreli's of the world(including OP) are blowing up short interest right now, and a bunch of people to short it. Meanwhile, funds are still heavily buying these into their portfolio, as they need exposure to risk/reward plays, and don't want to miss out on the potential. The current battle is Martin's short crowd vs funds, for short term price action. IF the funds keep buying, the shorts will have to cover, and short squeeze these guys to a new ATH in the next 60-90 days. I suspect funds/retail win, and we see IONQ at $100/share sometime before January, before it drops to $60-$70/share.

There is high execution risk in what they are doing and potential delays in schedule could fuck them. Competition is tough and will only grow. I really like the leadership and believe they can execute over the other Neo clouds. I also really like how they have potential moat (software stack on top of AI - i.e. if MSFT loves their services they will likely renew) vs other similar neo clouds who only offer inference as a service.

Even if on paper right now its on track to keep growing. 2) for some reason it feels to me that its gen-z or young people who are hyping this stock. Thats fine, and sometimes some audiences observe value faster than others, but it has me worried that there may be some angles/risks i dont understand. Maybe im wrong about this tho.

1ohm7o7,reddit_post,2025-10-27 18:22:41+00:00,2025-10-28 12:50:55+00:00,NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius),"NBIS earnings DD (Ne🅱️ius) TLDR/summary: NBIS is going to skyrocket after upcoming q3 earnings due to multiple upcoming bullish catalysts as well as ANOTHER upwards revision in ARR guidance for full year 2025. Positions: 8k worth of call options with most expiring 11/21. $100, $110, and $130 strikes are the main position. Will likely be adding into further OTM strikes as well, probably $140 and $150 when other funds settle. If you check my post history you will see a previously written speculation post on q3 earnings. This post will include a lot of the same information, with some extra. But positions have been rearranged to reflect real earnings date of 11/11 instead of 10/31 like I had originally thought. I did take a 3k loss due to this mistake earlier (that’s ok I’m fucking stupid) —————————————————————————— Company overview Nebius Group N.V. (NASDAQ: NBIS) is a European AI-infrastructure company based in Amsterdam with R&D hubs across Europe, Israel, and North America. Originally part of Yandex N.V., Nebius became its own pure-play “neo-cloud” infrastructure firm after spinning off all Russian assets in 2024. Today, Nebius operates data center infrastructure and provides a full-stack AI cloud platform (“Nebius AI Cloud”) serving startups, research labs, and hyperscalers. Nebius’s “platform as a service” (PaaS) adds another layer and acts as an alternative to the “infrastructure as a service”(IaaS) models that other Neo clouds use, such as IREN, CRWV, etc Current CEO Arkady Volozh was co-founder of Yandex. Dig a little deeper into their spin off from Russia and you will understand how talented the Nebius crew is today. They have plenty of experience in large scale cloud and AI systems experience. The only difference now is that they are starting with a clean slate, and access to western markets. —————————————————————————— Earnings preview [Q2 earnings](https://assets.nebius.com/assets/a1ea2731-32b4-4b8d-82b4-0557fddadd1a/Nebius%20-%20Financial%20results%20-%20Q2%202025.pdf?cache-buster=2025-08-26T16:52:29.128Z) was incredibly bullish for nebius, with an 2025 ARR guidance being revised upwards from 750m-1b to 900m-1.1b. Not only that, but they saw a 625% increase in revenue YoY. Q2 earnings were released on August 7, 2025. As you can see from q2 earnings, they were already poised for explosive growth. [Then, they went and signed a $17.4billion contract with MSFT](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1513845/000110465925088312/tm2525580d1_6k.htm) on September 8, 1 month after their q2 earnings call. The important thing to remember about the MSFT deal is that this is not instant revenue for NBIS. NBIS must have activated capacity to service the contract prior to receiving revenue from this. It is extremely unlikely that Nebius’ $900M–$1.1B ARR guidance (which was already revised up from previous) from Q2 earnings included money from the Microsoft deal. That guidance came out in August, while the contract wasn’t announced until september. Companies generally don’t build unfinished or undisclosed deals into official numbers. Along with that information, please check their 6k (linked above) - “Gpu services will be deployed in several tranches during 2025 and 2026”, meaning that at least part of the revenue from MSFT contract will be baked into 2025 figures. Rumor has it that the MSFT contract encompasses 300mW of activated capacity. Nebius guided for 220mW of build out by EOY’25 and 1GW by EOY ‘26. This again indicates that Nebius is ready to start collecting revenue from said contract this year. Given that average ARR over the life of the MSFT contract is a little less than 4b/year, if they even capture 1/4 of that in 2025 they will be effectively doubling their previously projected ARR for ‘25 Side note, a deal of this size with one of the biggest hyperscalers shows confidence in Nebius product and Nebius cloud. More companies will likely follow provided they execute MSFT deal well. —————————————————————————— Other tech earnings MSFT, GOOG, AMZN, META will be reporting earnings this week. I expect a lot of chatter regarding increased AI capex spend as well as increased need for more compute from these companies. This will run Nebius price up until they report earnings. —————————————————————————— NVDA GTC partnership speculation. NVDA has equity stake in Nebius. Nebius will be speaking at GTC, right after an NVDA announcement for a [partnership](https://www.nvidia.com/gtc/dc/session-catalog/?search=DC51273&tab.allsessions=1700692987788001F1cG#/ ) regarding AI agents and full stack software offerings (sound familiar?) the whole Nebius executive team will be there and will be the first ones to speak at 9:40am after this announcement. Nebius also teasing that they will be announcing something at GTC and to stay tuned. —————————————————————————— Macro bull catalysts - FOMC, rate cuts, a dovish Powell, and QT coming to an end. - Chyna deal —————————————————————————— Risks Macro risk Tech earnings bad / ai capex spend decrease(doubt) Hawkish Powell (doubt) Execution risk (doubt, leadership is awesome) —————————————————————————— Price target $160 by NOV 21. - Ne🅱️ius perma bull",JoeyVottoS,101,45,,dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ohm7o7/nbis_earnings_dd_neius/,wallstreetbets,,,

I have Invisalign $ALGN and it’s an awesome product. They also scan your mouth and use ai to predict the future movement of your teeth when they give you the trays. My teeth are almost perfect after using the product and it’s one of the best real world use cases of Ai I’ve seen. I also think rate cuts = people will be more likely to get braces because it’s an expensive thing The CEO also purchased 1m in shares in August around this price.

(NASDAQ: AMKR) is a leading U.S. semiconductor packaging and test company headquartered in Arizona. The firm is expanding its advanced packaging capacity on American soil, positioning itself at the center of the nation’s semiconductor reshoring push. In April 2025, NVIDIA announced it would begin manufacturing AI chips in the U.S., partnering with Amkor for packaging and testing in Arizona. NVIDIA’s new “Blackwell” AI chips mark a key milestone in bringing high-performance chip production back to the U.S. Amkor’s Q3 2025 earnings beat expectations, with revenue of $1.99 billion and EPS of $0.51, reflecting strong demand from AI and high-performance computing markets. Gross margin rose to 14.3 percent, and cash holdings increased to $2.1 billion after reducing debt by $400 million. CEO Giel Rutten will retire at the end of 2025 as Amkor boosts capital spending to about $950 million, including construction of its $7 billion advanced packaging campus in Arizona. Guidance for Q4 2025 forecasts revenue between $1.67 and $1.77 billion and EPS of $0.20 to $0.30. Shares rose roughly 3 percent in after-hours trading to around $33.73.

I've been digging into their White Mesa mill operations and what really gets me excited is that they're one of the only companies in North America that can actually process this stuff. China basically has a stranglehold on the entire supply chain, so when I see headlines about trade tensions, I'm personally buying more rather than selling.

1ohx878,reddit_post,2025-10-28 01:52:37+00:00,2025-10-28 12:50:56+00:00,The dip you have been waiting for. $UUUU DD,"The dip you have been waiting for. $UUUU DD Yes, another post about UUUU. I can hear the eye rolls already: another guy trying to pump his bags. But today’s selloff on the China trade deal headlines is precisely the kind of entry point where smart money starts to accumulate. Let me explain why with a short chemistry lesson, a look at how institutional capital is moving, and a dose of geopolitics. I’ve seen some DDs so I’ll try not to repeat too much, and I’ll make this more about inevitable reality than hype fluff. A Chemistry lesson : NdPr vs. Dy/Tb Everyone knows “rare earth magnets” mean NdPr (neodymium/praseodymium) magnets. They are found in smartphones, headphones, disk drives, and small motors. These magnets are strong and cheap, but their weakness is thermal: they start to lose strength at elevated temperatures. Enter dysprosium (Dy) and terbium (Tb). These heavy rare earth elements dramatically increase coercivity (resistance to demagnetization) when you dope NdPr magnets with them. They extend operating temperatures well beyond 150–200°C. Without Dy and Tb, the magnets in EV motors, wind turbines, and defense applications fail. These two elements are the bottleneck. they are the real risk for modern national-security grade magnets. I would bet that the govt in their infinite wisdom knows this. The MP deal splashed across headlines over the summer did nothing to address this bottleneck. It was designed to keep near-term U.S. magnet production alive and avoid a politically embarrassing and economically shocking supply chain shutdown. But it does not solve the heavy rare earth problem and the national security vulnerabilities that result. You can source NdPr but you cannot sidestep Dy and Tb. And today, as has been mentioned many times, China controls 99.8% of Dy/Tb refining capacity. That is why Washington’s “deal” with Beijing is a band-aid. The underlying wound is still bleeding: without Dy/Tb refining capacity inside U.S. borders, there is no secure supply chain for the only magnets that matter. Do we think Xi and Don will kiss and make up and be friends forever now? Where the Money Is Moving Now, let’s assume that the government knows it has no choice but to secure domestic Dy/Tb refining. They have recently teamed up with Orion Resource Partners and Abu Dhabi to set up the fund that will secure a non-Chinese supply chain for heavies. If you search for their press releases and info about this 1.8B fund: they have made their investment criteria explicit: they will only back shovel-ready or producing companies. This filters out the noise and removes most juniors. There is exactly one company in the United States that can refine Dy and Tb today: Energy Fuels (UUUU). While all of you regards were freaking out about the China deal today, JP Morgan announced its first $75M tranche today as part of a $1.5T capital allocation into critical materials. Smart money is entering the chat. And when it comes to Dy/Tb, there is no option: the board has exactly one square. The Geopolitical Angle EVs, defense systems, wind turbines and clean energy tech: all of these require Dy/Tb-doped magnets. The U.S. cannot outsource that supply to China without strategic vulnerability. A stopgap deal might buy a few quarters. But the Pentagon and DOE are under no illusion: they need a domestic Dy/Tb supply chain, and they need it yesterday. That means capital, both public and private, is being funneled toward the one company capable of executing. Valuation: The Elephant in the room Now, there is one legitimate concern that bears addressing: valuation. Yes, UUUU has already run and yes, the stock is expensive. How much is geopolitical leverage worth? How much is national security worth? How much does the US spend per year on the military? 1T? You think there is some accountant who is considering the DCF who is going to talk the DOW and Don out of investing in our countries geopolitical, economic, and military safety? Conclusion Ignore the noise and doom right now around rare earths. I won’t even go into why I think a major part of the correction in rare earth stocks is linked to a momentum factor trade that buckets them in with a bunch of other assets that have appreciated over the last year. The actual choke point vulnerability that the US has right now is refining Dy and Tb. Without them, there is no EV motor, no wind turbine generator, and no mission critical defense tech. UUUU is the only U.S. player with the refining capability right now. The government knows this. Orion and ADQ know this. JP Morgan knows this. Industry knows this. Be greedy when others are fearful. Positions: 40 Jan 20 Calls. I’m poor but I’m not wrong. No dates, no hype, I just know there is no other option.",batteryboner,131,59,,dd,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ohx878/the_dip_you_have_been_waiting_for_uuuu_dd/,wallstreetbets,,,

Rumours of an export ban (I’m assuming you mean a ban on Chinese Rare Earth Exports to the US) would bring these stocks up. MP (a miner), UUUU (a refiner and a miner), CRML (a miner) and UURAF (refiner) would all benefit from US/ western institutions being barred from consuming Chinese REE. It would also mean the US and the west would have to fast track/ financially prop up these 1st phase companies. This is what I mean by these stocks were priced in for perfection. Trumps tweet on the 10th caused these stocks to go crazy mode (looked like a deal wouldn’t happen) and then his tweet a few days later (saying the Chinese had a ‘bad moment’, and subsequent news on a china trade deal) caused these stocks to tank whilst the SP500 rallied (because China is the second largest economy and we want to be friends with them). My view on the SP500 is that it’s driven by corporate earnings at a high level. The SP500 is not the economy. Corporate earnings are going up, will continue to go up at AI reduces COGS. I think we are at the start of a super cycle but that’s beside the point. I have no idea what’s going on with ZIJIMY, I have never heard of it nor to I bother to look at Chinese companies. China in the long term will be punished for playing unfairly to the system everyone (the west) plays fair at (artificially pegging currency, stealing patents/ intellectual property, labour exploitation etc). LT view rare earths (particularly refiners like UURAF and UUUU) are the play because they are the backbone of the future. These stocks were extremely overbought and priced for perfect hence them falling. I will be buying more at a discount. The west cannot and will not rely on China (who has the upper hand) for much longer. You will be rewarded for riding out this volatility in the ST. Sorry for the rant!

Edit: GXC*** The title. Look at UUUU, LIT, ZIJMY, MP…. across the board plummet. Is there a play here on the mineral investor lag / spy overreacting? Or just another broken bubble? This addresses the plummet, but the explanation isn’t totally consistent to me. Either minerals still got kneecapped, so the deal isn’t substantive enough for a SPY rally… OR the whole mineral thing got resolved and there’s both a mineral and SPY rally. https://www.investors.com/news/rare-earth-stocks-sink-us-china-trade-deal-three-explanations/",No-Capital665,10,15,,discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oi26dd/spy_and_gxifxi_soar_bc_trump_in_china_easing/,wallstreetbets,,,

As for BYND, I've been plant based for 15 years. I've tried their products, they're fine but overpriced. The corporate financials have always been terrible. Their retail packaging can't compete with frozen angus meat on price, due to 10oz sizes, excessive packaging, and their decision to avoid soy and use pea protein, the price of which depends greatly on whether Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana and adjacent Canada are in drought. Eventually, some smart meat alternative co will come around. It won't depend on marketing, it will just sell acceptable soy flake + wheat gluten + veg oil based burgers, in 3+ lb simple packaging, at a 20%-40% discount to beef. They'll still make a gross profit, but will be priced at a point where omnivores are intrigued.

As demand for AI and cloud computing surges, data centers need faster and more energy-efficient connections - and that’s exactly what Lumentum builds. This puts them right at the center of a massive global infrastructure upgrade. The company recently reported strong revenue growth and expanding margins, driven by booming AI and data-center demand. Its acquisition of Cloud Light further strengthens its portfolio and accelerates future growth potential. Despite all this, the stock remains attractively valued and largely overlooked as investor focus stays on chipmakers.

SK hynix has dominant position in the HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) market, a critical component in GPU architecture for artificial intelligence. With over a 50% share of this niche, the company has become a key supplier to Nvidia, which uses SK chips in virtually its entire high-performance line. This position has been reinforced with the arrival of HBM4, already validated for production ahead of the competition, and with billion-dollar investments in advanced packaging and manufacturing capacity in the US and Korea. With the HBM market projected to double by 2027, the company positions itself not simply as a memory supplier, but as a critical infrastructure for the expansion of AI. Besides its technical expertise, SK hynix benefits from difficult-to-replicate structural characteristics: custom thermal engineering, superior yield in EUV lithography, and custom die-based contracts, which create friction for supplier switching. Management has been delivering operating margins above 40% and maintaining CAPEX discipline, even with the aggressive increase in demand. This means that profits are not coming solely from high prices, but from solid execution. There are risk, such as memory cycles, competition from Samsung/Micron, and geopolitical tensions, but SK hynix is defending itself with strategic investments in the US (Indiana) and a diversified pipeline (DRAM, NAND, high-density SSDs). Ultimately, what makes this thesis special is that SK hynix is at the center of a physical AI problem: bandwidth between the chip and memory has become a bottleneck, and it is the one providing the bridge. Every additional percentage point of thermal and signal efficiency results in more tokens/second in the real world and this has value for end customers. The market is beginning to price this stock more as ""critical AI infrastructure"" than as a ""cyclical memory supplier."" If this view prevails, the rerate of multiples and earnings could transform SK hynix into one of the IA largest caps worldwide.",pedronegreiros94,3,25,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1of7zqg/sk_hynix_an_overlooked_korean_company_that/,stocks,,,

Despite Google claiming to have solved a really complex math problem years ago, it wasn't actually anything useful, and quantum computers had yet to do anything actually useful. I e. A good analogy to what Google did would be trying to run calculations on where a penny would land if you threw it off a building. You could try to run a bunch of really complicated math to figure it out, or you could do the simpler and more logical thing of just throwing the penny and seeing where it landed. And even if they can get quantum computers to actually do something useful there's other very severe challenges to making a quantum computer useful to the masses. The biggest one being how little memory quantum computers have, and how difficult it is to add more, because basically the memory has to be properly shielded, or else outside interference will make the entire calculation worthless.

FICO, CBs, Resellers, and Banks (end customer). FICO provides the algo to CBs, CBs provide consumer data + FICO score (generated by using the algo from FICO) to the Resellers, Resellers then give this to Bank. With the direct licensing model, Resellers get the consumer data from CBs and the FICO score from FICO. This matters because like I mentioned, CBs charge double the price of the FICO score for a 100% margin. By bypassing the CBs, the CBs lose a huge revenue stream while decreasing the price for Resellers and Banks. In addition, FICO gets a more personal relationship with Resellers, allowing them to increase their prices at will. Previously: FICO sells score to CBs for $5, CBs upcharge to $10 (100% margin for no work), Resellers buy for $10. Now: FICO sells score to Resellers for $5 + $33 should the loan be underwritten, or just sells score for $10. From the Reseller's perspective, nothing changes or the score just got cheaper. In addition, it weakens the possibility of resellers using VS as CBs will have a lower chance of bundling it with FICO.",thelastsubject123,3,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ofeu8t/fico_strong_buy_ahead_of_earnings_on_110525_and/nl8xs8o/,stocks,,,

During my follow up, FICO was trading at roughly $2200, with an even higher valuation of 92 PE. Today, FICO trades at $1667 as of market close, trading at 65x TTM earnings, and an estimated forward PE of \~46x. This implies a forward EPS of $36, which would be 20% Growth for the estimated FY25 EPS of $30. So what has happened in the past 18 months to FICO's business? FICO has grown substantially, with revenues growing 17% in the TTM, Operating Margin expanding 400 bps, and EPS growing 34%. Their core business remains unchallenged and maintains a stranglehold on every business that needs a FICO score. That being said, they've gotten some bad attention, specifically from the FHFA (Federal Housing Financial Agency), specifically related to their mortgage score increases. Here's the brief rundown: 30-40% of FICO's scores business is mortgages. A score cost $0.60 in 2022. It now costs $4.95, or roughly 8.25x in 3 years. 5 months ago,The FHFA blames FICO (erroneously) for rising house prices, claiming that this $4.35 price increase is responsible for hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of home appreciation prices, despite the average closing transaction cost being \~$7500, meaning FICO represents less than 0.1%. In addition, it conveniently omits the fact that the credit bureaus (Equifax, Transunion, and Experian) take a FICO score, mark it up 100%, and resell it for $10, netting them a 100% margin for doing nothing. This sent FICO tumbling from a peak of $2200 to a trough of $1300. Again, nothing about the business changed, just the PE multiple. More recently however, FICO has announced a direct licensing program which would allow institutions to bypass CBs and give the money directly to FICO. This is a stroke of genius to say the least. It enables FICO to have more control over their pricing strategy while increasing their margins while weakening the strength of CBs. Institutions will have two options: FICO gets paid $4.95 per score, and receives a $33 royalty for every loan that is underwritten successfully. Alternatively, institutions can choose to pay $10 for just a score, similar to the current model where CBs markup FICO's work for 100% margins. To summarize it for FICO, worst case scenario, nothing changes. Best case, their top and bottom line can now go even higher. As a result, FICO went up 20% after announcing this direct license program. Truthfully, I was surprised it didn't go up more as they're telling the street EPS estimates for the next decade are too low with this new change. That being said, most of those gains have been given up due to Equifax setting VantageScore (FICO's alternative) to be the same price as FICO, and being freely given for the next two years for anyone who buys a FICO score. This is a non-issue. VS has been around for two decades and has next to no traction. As a reminder, this $5 FICO score safeguards loans ranging from the hundreds of thousands of dollars to the millions. For every 1 basis point of risk you incur by choosing an inferior score, you will pay hundreds of dollars more in defaults. Even if VS were free, it would not be cheap enough to compensate for the excess risk. Finally, rates are finally going down. The mortgage industry has been in a slump since rates rose from 25 bps to 525 bps. Mortgage volumes are roughly 50% below their decade median. Should mortgage volumes normalize (aka double), FICO will double their profits overnight due to their scores having a 90% EBIT margin. This quickly cuts their 47 forward PE to a 23.5. This is before any further price increases. TL;DR FICO is the gold standard and has announced it is tightening its stranglehold on institutions even more. We'll see more clarity in the success of their direct licensing program when they announce their guidance for 2026 and the stock is a strong buy. The business will grow their EPS by 25% pa for at least the next decade, meaning the shares are ironically very undervalued despite a 65 PE.",thelastsubject123,20,9,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ofeu8t/fico_strong_buy_ahead_of_earnings_on_110525_and/,stocks,,,

It's not that it will stop growing but do I think the unusually fantastic *rate* of growth in growth stocks that you have seen for much of the last 5 years is sustainable? No. Do I think the kind of market that has been the case for the last 5 years is sustainable? I wouldn't complain if it was but I don't think it's realistic. Would not surprise me if 5-10 years from now there are people who are going to be new to investing who will be envious of people who were able to take advantage of the kind of gains during the last 5 years.

S&P 500 isn't dramatically better, where those names are a bit more than 40% of the index. Bubbles don't last forever, and the new names after the recovery in the top 10 change.

I have some small positions but rare earths (and hot commodities in general) is not something that I would make into a larger allocation. People also piled into lithium in 2020 because everyone thought there would be an EV in every driveway and something like ALB went from the $50's to over $300 and then...completely round-tripped all the way back to the $50's. It's bounced lately with all the discussion of stockpiling and strategic minerals but the people who bought anywhere near the highs are going to probably be bagholding for a very long time. So many times when a commodity becomes hot like lithium in 2020 people think ""this is the future, this time is different"" and then a bunch of supply comes online, demand starts to cool and you're left with a glut. I can see a scenario where rare earths would do reasonably well in the coming years, but also keeping in mind what happened post bubble in 2011.

I'll preface this by saying i don't own stocks in any of the companies mentioned in this post, I'm mainly interested in the potential of this segment. My main points: - China doesn't seem to have plans to change their policy of allowing rare earth metals to be exported only if they agree with their use. This means without them the US can't even build tech or defense systems, something China is obviously okay with. - You can find rare earth metals literally everywhere, as evident by the weekly news articles about huge deposits being found. The rareness comes from the lack and difficulty of stablishing processing facilities. - LYC (Lynas Rare Earths Ltd) is back to where it was before the deal with the US is signed - Other stocks like UAMY, USAR, NB, UUUU, etc were gaining a lot of steam until the deal, when they saw a significant drop and some of them haven't fully recovered - Few countries have the resources to invest in this, and seeing how China has been in a steady pace to be self reliant no doubt more will follow. This coupled with the current government trying (or at least saying) to reshore manufacturing, means that the Australia deal is mainly a temporary band aid. - US companies know this, there are multiple reports of increase investment like [Aclara](https://www.opportunitylouisiana.gov/news/aclara-invests-277-million-to-build-nations-first-heavy-rare-earth-separation-facility-in-southwest-louisiana) - [Simply Wall St](https://simplywall.st/en/stocks/us/materials/nasdaq-usar/usa-rare-earth) Community fair value forecasts for USAR are reaching $80 (current price is 23) - Something I haven't seen mentioned much. Since not every country has the resources to process these metals, establishing a US pipeline for them not only would allow not depending on China/Australia for them, but would also open the market for exports with all current trading partners. I think long-term growth is fairly safe, but short term the segment is a bit shaky, mainly due to government meddling. The only way this trend reverses is if China changes their policy, but the more self reliant they get, the least they depend on other countries, so changing their policy doesn't make any sense (specially since this is the plan they've been following for the past ~20 years) So the question is not really how much is this segment going to grow, but when. So, is this only a buy & hold or is there potential for short-term movement as well?",Zeitzen,0,27,,industry discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ofg7ft/is_this_a_good_time_to_get_into_rare_metals/,stocks,,,

A PE of 21 is way too high in this sector. This is down from nearly 25 a year ago. Verizon and T are 8 to 9. Verizon’s stock has done nothing the past 2 years. It’s down 33% vs TMUS being up 108% over the past 5 years. Verizon’s new CEO will probably announce a new strategy to stop the stock fall which has been 11% the past 4 weeks. TMUS has a growth PE because it was taking market share in a mature market but the market is sensing a pivot. Their growth at the expense of T and VZ maybe over. I own VZ. It’s been a tough hold over the past few years but I add to my position when it falls below 40. The dividend yield of over 7% is very good but the new CEO and BOD could cut it to fund acquisitions and growth.

Some positions that were small positions that I wasn't going to add further to were sold, some larger positions that I like long-term and have a low cost basis were trimmed somewhat but otherwise kept. Looked for things out of favor in recent weeks that I didn't think deserved to be out of favor to that degree and re-deployed into things like ISRG, which went on to have very good earnings. Wasn't finding new ideas in aggressive growth, so changed things up and screened for what was technically oversold or just outright hadn't done well this year. Yes, it's been a mostly great five+ years for growth but twice in the recent past (2022, 2025) people have given back considerable gains because they invested as if those periods couldn't happen. This sub was wildly bullish late last year, most of this sub acted like it was the apocalypse in April at the bottom and now we're getting close to going full circle back to bullish. I don't get the ""I randomly wake up one morning and decide some name that is really good and I really like has gone up too much so I'll just dump it"" but I do think that - especially in this market where anything hot goes so much further so much quicker than it used to as people pile in - that at some points it's prudent to trim some and at some points it's prudent to change the playbook a bit. ""Don't be greedy"" I think this is a different market than it used to be and I don't know if it's greedy as much as it is people get complacent when stuff goes up literally every single day. There is tremendous FOMO and I think there's a lot of people who are using the market to try to keep up with the cost of living and overextend on risk. You can have a market that goes up every day and people can still destroy their portfolio because they piled into an options bet that went wrong or piled into BYND. Someone mentioned something about PMI yesterday and searching on here it's apparently been a thing recently (someone full ported it on WSB: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1oezqi3/i_am_in_agony) It turned out to be a pump and dump, down 70% at open yesterday. I looked up the HQ address (something that I often do with small/micro caps) and this is apparently a medical company that is in a HQ that looks like a repurposed public storage facility in the middle of nowhere and for some reason the core product of the business is a separate company? I have no idea about the company never heard of it before but at first glance it doesn't inspire confidence. I dunno, I think every situation is different but the idea of taking some off the table is not wrong. I do think a lot of people have piled into the markets in recent years and hopefully they can find help on here. Too many people looking at things like BYND or tiny companies nobody's ever heard of. I'm definitely not one to tell people to try to get rich *very slowly*, but there's starting to be examples again about how trying to get rich *very quickly* can wind up imploding your account even in a fantastic market.",dvdmovie1,2,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ofmosb/if_your_stock_goes_up_100_sell_half_of_it_and/nla9wh4/,stocks,,,

A good way to see this is that the value of my assets plus short sell proceeds (A + SP) have to be a minimum of 125% of the market value of the short position A + SP >= 1.25 * MVSP Here is my question: when exactly am I borrowing from my broker? From what I’ve seen online, there are two ways to accrue interest from a short sell position: - The Cost to Borrow, interest paid to the person lending me the stocks - Margin loan interest paid to my broker I’m confused about the second, when is my broker ever lending me anything in this entire process? My ASSETS and Short sell Proceeds (A + SP) have to always cover a 25% increase in the market value of the short position minimum (A + SP >= MVSP + 25% MVSP) otherwise I get margin called. In other words, it’s impossible for me be in a situation where I have to borrow money from my broker to cover the value of the short sell position because I’d be margin called before that! Remember, maintenance margin requires me to keep 25% increase assets to cover for potential forward upwards mouvemrnt in the stock price! So is it the case that I only borrow cash from my broker and owe them interest in the event that I get margin called and I don’t have enough in Assets + SP to cover the MVSP so they have to use their own cash to close the position (meaning buy back the stock at current market price and give them back to the lender)?",masseaterguy,3,11,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ofzn7u/margin_loans_when_short_selling/,stocks,,,

Strong Free Cash Flow: Robust free cash flow signifies that a company generates sufficient cash from operations to fund growth initiatives, pay dividends, or reduce debt, highlighting financial flexibility. 4. Low Debt: A manageable debt level ensures that a company is not over-leveraged, reducing financial risk and the burden of interest obligations. 5.

Having 5-10% of your portfolio as fun money is totally reasonable to someone like me. I even have a separate trading account for high risk/high reward plays. It's at 35% profit since I opened it in June. It was heading towards 50% before TACO froday happened. But also, it is easy to be in profit in a manipulated bullish market. You've been trading 2 years. The learning curve is pretty big if you're playing with your own money. This market is not typical of the last decade. Valuations on companies run on PE debt are insane and that's what is gonna bring it down pretty soon. This is obviously not standard investment advice. None of this is financial advice at all. Do these decisions get easier? yes. I think they do. I think the main thing is that for these plays, you have to be OK with a 25-40% gain and pull intermittent profits. Let some ride if you want. Letting it all ride above 30% gains is OK if you're willing to lose the entire ""investment"". Options, I wouldn't do anything beyond calls on these highly volatile plays personally. Now, as for BYND, that was a weird one because the market halted it over a dozen times that day. So, psychologically, it was a shitshow and very difficult to gauge because momentum stalled constantly. The options chains were shut down for longer throughout the day. I think judging one's psychology on that one alone will be skewed. So don't be too hard on yourself. That's assuming you're not in over $3-4 on it. If so, then you need to seriously consider why you chased it that high on a stock that started at .60. Also, consider what the psychology was behind how much you put into it. If you want to FOMO in with 500 vs 5000 vs 50,000 is all part of it. I feel your pain on this one. Adrenaline is real when stocks are running like that. FOMO is a terrible reason to get in. The only time I've been stung really hard is chasing and not being patient. This is when we need to remember to go outside and touch grass and let the market do what it is gonna do, without us. My point in bringing that up is that no matter how long you been in it, even with pump and dumps or speculative stocks, BYND is an anomaly. I think it had a lot of misinformation going on from top players to bottom shillers and side to side, which didnt help alongside the trading halts. I'm really curious to see where it ends up. What I learned over the years though is, profit is profit - take it. Don't look back and don't jump back in. There will always be another play.

Read the README. It isn’t a trading system and it isn’t a shortcut. It is a clear visual reconstruction of the “leak” phenomenon that isn’t a leak at all. It is process-driven privilege in plain sight. What it is: A compact public-data rig that pulls disclosures, price history, and reconciliation logic to recreate the pattern. The crude brackets, lagging timestamps, and delayed reporting make the edge obvious. Anyone with earlier access wins. Everyone else reverse-engineers the smoke trail after the move. Why it’s public: People keep asking where the leaks come from. The answer is structural. Transparency by code makes that undeniable. This tool lets you rebuild the sequence from incomplete public crumbs and watch the advantage materialise step by step. Notes: Read the README before running. This is an exploration utility, not a signal engine. Not financial advice. This is not how I trade. For serious, reproducible tooling, see my other repos. This one exists for clarity, not alpha.

I took a look at details about DAUq and ARPU today. ## ARPU in the last 4 quarters, the worst growths were: Int ARPU: -20% US ARPU: -11% The best cases were: Int ARPU: 29% US ARPU: 26% That would bring us to a range of: Int ARPU: 1,39$ - 2,23$ US ARPU: 7$-9,88$ I dont think ARPU will go down, as ADs got very much better, so I assume the range is like: **Int ARPU: 1,73$ - 2,23$** **US ARPU: 7,87$-9,88$** ## DAUq If we now look at DAUq, the data suggests 119M total, but lets just take a calculation: wost growth: Int DAUq: 4% US DAUq: 0% Best growth: Int DAUq: 10% US DAUq: 6% This scenarios put us in the range of 112M-119M. My bearcase here is only 1% US growth and 4% international. We had a special event with the murder of Kirk and some other topics, I really think the 118-119M will hold here. That come down to: **50,8M - 53,2M US DAUq** **62,5M - 65M Int DAUq** # # ##AI # I really think they will announce a new deal, at least for OpenAI and Google. Either with the earnings or soon after. I calculate now ONLY 15M in the bear case per quarter (actual number) and 25M for both in the neutral and 50M in the bullcase. Read here: [https://stockpsycho.com/before-the-beat-reddits-ai-licensing-shift-could-flip-the-earnings-narrative/](https://stockpsycho.com/before-the-beat-reddits-ai-licensing-shift-could-flip-the-earnings-narrative/) I read through this and I personally agree. Reddit will license the new AI deal maybe even with something like 1 Bn $ total. **His bear case is 375M licensing revenue from AI, which has NO additional costs for reddit. This will be 1:1 net revenue nearly.** # Cases ## Bear Case We have 1% US DAUq growth only (Charly Kirk will bring some) and 4% Int growth (worst growth in 4 quarters. ARPU will bring around the same as last quarter, I dont think this can anyway go down. AI will bring 15M each quarter. Revenue in this scenario is 522M Costs will rise about 12% (including Tax costs) to 460M and so we will have only around **62M net income** **Forware P/E: 161** ## Neutral Case We take around 3% growth for US and 7% Int DAUq, which is the average for the last 4 quarters. ARPU will rise for INT and US 13%, like the average of the last 4 quarters. This brings us to AI, still 15M. Revenue here will be around 586M Costs will rise about 9% (including Tax costs) to 447M and so we will have only around **128M net income.** **Forware P/E: 74** ## BULL CASE We take around 6% growth for US and 10% Int DAUq, which is the bestfor the last 4 quarters. ARPU will rise for INT 29% and US 26%, like the bestof the last 4 quarters. This brings us to AI, still 15M. Revenue here will be around 685M Costs will rise about 9% (including Tax costs) to 447M and so we will have only around **237M net income.** **Forware P/E: 42** ## Assumptions I dont think RDDT will grow that good for DAUq, but for ARPU I still beliefe this. Also I really think that AI will be anounced. If I take NO growth in DAUq and only the best growth in ARPU, I still land on 631M revenue for the quarter. This is without AI 15M. If they manage to keep the costs a little lower, then you see how fast this could grow to a low P/E stock. We are 1-2 quarters away from an explosion. Reddit will blow away in the next 2 quarters with the new AI deal. If this brings only 250M yearly, this means directly more net income, as this is nothing were RDDT needs any ressourced additionally. ## Outlook: Reddits revenue grew around 16% each quarter average, the costs only increased 9% average. AI licensing will not increase the costs. I assume a growth of around 20% revenue each quarter for the next year. **My pricetarget for 12/26:** **Revenue Q3/26: 1,200 M** **Costs Q3/26: 559 M** **Net Income (new AI deal 375M and organic growth): 656M from RDDT and 90M per Q from AI Lics = 750M** **ARPU 2027: 52$ US and 12$ INT (vs Meta 68$ and 13$)** **Forward P/E Q3/26: 35 (assumed)** **STOCKPRICE 12/26: 550** **Market Cap: 105 Bn$** App Download explosion: [https://www.reddit.com/r/redditstock/comments/1oe79sc/reddit\_app\_download\_is\_exploding/](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditstock/comments/1oe79sc/reddit_app_download_is_exploding/) RDDT overtakes Wikipedia: [https://www.reddit.com/r/redditstock/comments/1oe1t1d/reddit\_overtakes\_wikipedia/](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditstock/comments/1oe1t1d/reddit_overtakes_wikipedia/) Whats your opinion?",slocs1,148,41,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ogkp04/rddt_earnings_forecast_prediction/,stocks,,,

Unlike 2016 China is now a much larger player in every respect. And have a huge amount of leverage, which they have been preparing for years to use. These trade disputes hurt both sides sure, but due to the political cycle nature of US government and the fact China is an authoritarian one party state, China can afford to play a long game while the US adminstration always needs a quick win. Meaning the US will always compromise, especially with mid terms coming up, and American farmers/ranchers etc grumbling in red states that they have been ""sold out"". Essentially, I don't see an outcome here that is ""favourable"" to the US. Trump is TACO for a reason as the markets recognise all of the above. They will get all of what they want (tariffs dropped, advanced chips etc) and the US will get some token soybean purchases.

He also said the two sides had also discussed another extension in a series of truces on tariffs they have engaged in this year.

Ex-Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares said this week he doesn't think Tesla will still produce cars in 10 years. I've compared new models Teslas and BYDs side-by-side and I don't get how Tesla can continue to complete with an inferior, overpriced product. On the other hand, Tesla has done extremely well in the US market (where Chinese cars are largely excluded and there is minimal penetration of several EU EV cars). Tesla has adeptly capitalized on US govt subsidies for car purchases. However, while Tesla's sales are still growing in the US, its share of the EV market is already plummeting. On a recent trip through Latin America, I was surprised how deep the penetration of Chinese EVs has already become. Is it really just a matter or time till Tesla stock collapses, or can the company remain profitable and transition in other directions?",ChicoRunningBack,634,480,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ogm00c/is_the_investing_world_just_waiting_for_tesla_to/,stocks,,,

[https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ask-ibkr.php](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/ask-ibkr.php) Interactive Brokers just rolled out ""Ask IBKR"", an AI chat that lets you ask things like “What’s my P&L this month?” or “Show my largest positions.” Presumably they'll be rolling out additional analytics on top that let you do heavier insights eventually (sector attribution, risk catalysts, maybe even trade recommendations). Probably in its infancy right now. But feels like every platform these days is moving toward some form of chat-prompted interface...Meta’s hardware, ChatGPT’s app integrations, plenty others...maybe finance could be next. The whole goal should be to *simplify* 95% of interactions anyway, right? Like imagine you could connect **any** of your brokerages to some agent, and run all the analysis you want. * “Why did I underperform the S&P this quarter? Am I overweight some bad industry?"" * ""Chart me this correlation. Chart me that earnings release history."" * ""Show me the main upcoming catalysts this week for my holdings"" * ""What's the lowest tax-burden way for me to free up some cash for other investments?"" Do you think this kind of plain-English interface would make it easier (or more appealing) to interact with your portfolio day-to-day? More streamlined to understand upcoming risks?

This sub was wildly bullish late last year, apocalyptic in April and in just about a year we're slowly getting back to most of the sub being bullish again. This sub in late 2020/21 was talking about piling into Ark funds (and ARKK is still down over the last 5 years despite being up 57% YTD) and yet this year, the market goes up every day and a fair amount of this sub has basically reacted ""not like this!"" the whole time. I just don't think the concern that I see is a material factor in the market going up. If someone comes on here every day since April as the market has continued ramping higher and sees repetitive varirations on the same bearish posts day in/day out, at what point do a lot of people simply tune that out? I'm not saying that there aren't concerns with the market, but people making the same bear case day in/day out eventually get tuned out by many. IMO, the WAY bigger concern that I have is that I think there are a lot of people overextending themselves into risk to try and keep up with the cost of living. The market (at least to me) is far more casino-ish than ever and the kind of risks that I see people taking is concerning. People full porting options, buying tiny names that turn out to be pump and dumps, the eagerness to throw money into BYND and hope that you're one of the people who gets out before the music stops, etc. People are reaching further and further into risk/turning their entire portfolio into gambling (and hey, they recently announced 5x leveraged single name etfs the other day) and that concerns me from a societal level. How many young people think they'll never be able to afford a house so the money ends up being YOLO'd into the latest meme?

NFLX just said last week during their earnings call they have no interest in acquring legacy media networks. Sure every legacy media network seems to have a streaming platform now, but it's just a fraction of the business and not the core. NFLX is purely a tech company that happens to stream media. They've always been known to have an innovative tech stack and one of the highest hiring bars. When you look at NFLX current top streaming charts, what do you see? The list is dominated by new releases; not by stuff released 3/5/10/15 years ago. What pulls in the subscriptions and advertising then is the new content, not the old. So what value do these all time fan favorite shows really have? Factor in a premium the current shareholders would want in a buyout and value proposition isn't that great. NFLX would rather pump hundreds of millions/low billions into creating their news content - they can make 8-12+ shows for the cost of AMCX.",greenpride32,1,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oh9vv5/why_nobody_is_bidding_for_amcx/nln6thz/,stocks,,,

The market cap is low but the enterprise value is much higher due to leverage. They bought back more than a billion in shares while leveraging up and now they are up to their necks in debt. As for why nobody is buying them up, you should check what content they actually own. Breaking Bad and stuff arent actually their property (Sony owns it(, they just own streaming rights for certain regions. But they do have a viable content studio. They produce mostly horror for their own streaming service which has around 13M premium subscribers. Its a niche but then again the stock is worth next to nothing. I hold it for two scenarios.

AMC Networks does not only sound like that famous meme-stock, but it is a great business on paper - it created or distributed some of the best TV series of all time: Breaking Bad, Mad Men, The Walking Dead and countless spinoffs, Hell on Wheels, Halt and Catch Fire, Better Call Saul, Interview with the Vampire, Silo (for Apple TV) and Pantheon among others. It owns five television channels, including AMC, BBC America, IFC and Sundance TV. It has its own streaming service (actually nine, but who's counting). At the same time its share price went from ATH of around 80 USD to the current price of around 8 USD, a 90% drop. The market cap is a tiny 340M USD, which is peanuts for any big player like NFLX, AAPL, AMZN, or even WBD or the new kid on the block PSKY, who just bid for WBD. So, the question is why there's no bidding activity for them? Are the vultures just waiting for it to go belly up and buy the assets on the cheap? Do the owners think that they will turn the business around, and the current price (or even a 3x price) doesn't reflect the true value of the enterprise?

Let's say you live in Turkey where the Turkish Lira's value has fallen drastically in the past decade due to inflation and incompetent central banking. Now, with stable coins, instead of betting on Turkey to have their currency be strong, you can have say USD on a stable coin. This means that the money you earn in Lira can be easily transferred on a network (say Solana) which you use to store USD (say USDC, one of the most popular ones). At the end of the day, living in a poor country, you don't need to worry about the exchange rate for your savings and keep in USD or even buy gold ""stable coins"". Other countries can have their own tokens. There's the Euro, I know that there are plans by companies like Shopify and National Bank of Canada to create a CAD stable coin. This allows people to trade without barriers and fees from any exchanges. At the same time, say for Canada, if non Canadians use the stable coin, since it's backed by Canadian treasuries, the national dept can be paid off with a lower rate because of the higher demand. The same goes for other countries with high demand currency like the US. Some people talked about using crypto for stock exchanges. This allows people who otherwise cannot access the NYSE through their broker, bank or if they don't have a bank. This means more accessibility for stocks and ETFs by tokenizing the asset. Check out NVDAx for instance which is a token that is worth 1 NVDA share. It's not perfect, but for people living outside of NA/Europe, it's a great way to save money without the influence of your government who can easily seize your assets. There are risks of no regulation obviously and I'm not 100% on board with all of what I said. But a crypto wallet (especially if it's a physical ""cold wallet"") is a lot safer in most countries than a bank account. Even in Russia. With sanctions and the removal of the USD from the economy, you cannot invest in the American stock exchange with your bank there. It's also illegal to own more than a certain % of your net value in foreign currencies. With crypto, this is all gone. Theoretically.

The AI chips are a shift from Qualcomm, which has thus far focused on semiconductors for wireless connectivity and mobile devices, not massive data centers. Qualcomm said that both the AI200, which will go on sale in 2026, and the AI250, planned for 2027, can come in a system that fills up a full, liquid-cooled server rack. Qualcomm is matching Nvidia and AMD, which offer their graphics processing units, or GPUs, in full-rack systems that allow as many as 72 chips to act as one computer. AI labs need that computing power to run the most advanced models. Qualcomm’s data center chips are based on the AI parts in Qualcomm’s smartphone chips called Hexagon neural processing units, or NPUs. “We first wanted to prove ourselves in other domains, and once we built our strength over there, it was pretty easy for us to go up a notch into the data center level,” Durga Malladi, Qualcomm’s general manager for data center and edge, said on a call with reporters last week. The entry of Qualcomm into the data center world marks new competition in the fastest-growing market in technology: equipment for new AI-focused server farms. Nearly $6.7 trillion in capital expenditures will be spent on data centers through 2030, with the majority going to systems based around AI chips, according to a McKinsey estimate. The industry has been dominated by Nvidia, whose GPUs have over 90% of the market so far and sales of which have driven the company to a market cap of over $4.5 trillion. Nvidia’s chips were used to train OpenAI’s GPTs, the large language models used in ChatGPT. But companies such as OpenAI have been looking for alternatives, and earlier this month the startup announced plans to buy chips from the second-place GPU maker, AMD, and potentially take a stake in the company. Other companies, such as Google, Amazon and Microsoft, are also developing their own AI accelerators for their cloud services. Qualcomm said its chips are focusing on inference, or running AI models, instead of training, which is how labs such as OpenAI create new AI capabilities by processing terabytes of data. The chipmaker said that its rack-scale systems would ultimately cost less to operate for customers such as cloud service providers, and that a rack uses 160 kilowatts, which is comparable to the high power draw from some Nvidia GPU racks. Malladi said Qualcomm would also sell its AI chips and other parts separately, especially for clients such as hyperscalers that prefer to design their own racks. He said other AI chip companies, such as Nvidia or AMD, could even become clients for some of Qualcomm’s data center parts, such as its central processing unit, or CPU. “What we have tried to do is make sure that our customers are in a position to either take all of it or say, ‘I’m going to mix and match,’” Malladi said. The company declined to comment, the price of the chips, cards or rack, and how many NPUs could be installed in a single rack. In May, Qualcomm announced a partnership with Saudi Arabia’s Humain to supply data centers in the region with AI inferencing chips, and it will be Qualcomm’s customer, committing to deploy up to as many systems as can use 200 megawatts of power. Qualcomm said its AI chips have advantages over other accelerators in terms of power consumption, cost of ownership, and a new approach to the way memory is handled. It said its AI cards support 768 gigabytes of memory, which is higher than offerings from Nvidia and AMD.

Denholm said Musk was key to the future of the EV maker as it moves beyond being “just another car company,” with a bigger focus on Full Self Driving and Optimus. “Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become,” Denholm wrote. Denholm told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” on Monday that the company is at an “important inflection point” with artificial intelligence at the forefront. “The opportunity for Tesla in the future, given this AI focus and attention and the unique capabilities that we have as an organization, and that Elon brings to us, really does mean that the opportunity for the company ahead of us is significant,” she said. Several groups have publicly opposed the pay package in recent days, with proxy advisor Institutional Shareholder Services recommending against it. Last week, a group of unions and corporate watchdogs launched the Take Back Tesla website to oppose the pay package, noting Musk’s embracing of right-wing political movements and amplifying of conspiracy theories that have damaged the brand. Tesla’s annual meeting is Nov. 6, with the shareholder vote for Musk’s pay and other proposals closing at 11:59 p.m. ET on Nov. 5. Tesla reported third-quarter financials last week, missing earnings expectations but posting a 12% increase in revenue after two straight periods of declines. The proposed plan for Musk, which was outlined by the board in September, consists of 12 tranches of shares granted to Musk if Tesla hits certain milestones. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, which he has publicly demanded for the past year and mentioned again on Tesla’s earnings call last week in reference to the growth of Optimus robots. “If we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army?” Musk said to analysts. “I don’t feel comfortable building that robot army if I don’t have at least a strong influence.” The full award would give Musk, who already holds about 13% of the EV maker, more than 423 million additional shares and take his stake to about 25%. “He’s been very consistent in that view, in terms of having enough influence over the vote of Tesla in the future so that bad things can’t happen with the AI,” Denholm told CNBC. “So it’s less about compensation and more about the voting influence.” Denholm, who noted that retail traders make up about 30% of Tesla’s shareholder base, said last year was a record turnout for the vote. She also asked that shareholders vote to re-elect Ira Ehrenpreis, Joe Gebbia and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to the board.

That money has been re-deployed in real asset names and some oversold/moderately out of favor names that I didn't think deserved to be. ISRG is a recent example, then it had great earnings not long after. So basically, trim AI/AI-related stuff moderately, keep the rest to varying degrees in most cases and then re-deploy elsewhere. If the AI names continued higher over the coming months, I'd trim a bit more into strength. All this isn't because I think there's an imminent bubble pop but I've had a great year and want to protect that some. People gave a lot back in 2022/early 2025. I have no idea when the next early 2025 will be, nor do I know if markets will bounce in the same manner they have in recent years after the next one but I just don't think the rate of gains that I've had since the bottom six months ago will continue over the next six months. There's very little I think is appealing when I look through what's hot (a lot of it would have to correct fairly sizably before I'd buy/add back), but I have found some opportunities lately in what's not. So for me it's never going to be ""I'm going to cash"" or just dump AI exposure entirely because one day I randomly decide the stocks are too high, it's mildly dialing down risk if I think that's prudent and occasionally changing the playbook (rather than being on the offensive and looking entirely for growth, play some defense and look at out of favor/oversold names.)",dvdmovie1,3,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ohgu99/brkb_as_the_best_defensive_waiting_game/nlo45fk/,stocks,,,

The U.S. Department of Energy has just announced a $1 billion partnership with AMD to build two new supercomputers. One, named Lux, is expected to be operational within six months. These systems will feature AMD's new MI355X AI chips alongside AMD CPUs and networking equipment. They will be deployed across diverse fields from nuclear research to cancer treatment and national security, with potential applications even in fusion energy. What caught my attention is AMD's positioning. While everyone focuses on Nvidia's AI advancements, AMD is quietly collaborating with the U.S. government on projects that could shape its long-term technological leadership. This isn't about gaming GPUs it's about controlling the infrastructure of the next computing era. Having followed AMD on and off for years, this deal feels like a turning point, shifting AMD's narrative from “AI competitor” to “AI foundation.” If they deliver on these commitments, it could significantly elevate AMD's credibility, especially in enterprise and high-performance computing. But AMD's path has never been smooth. What do you think? Will this deal have lasting impact? Or is it just another flashy headline in the AI hype cycle?",RoutineLegal3981,89,61,,company discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ohhu8u/amd_lands_1_billion_ai_deal_has_it_finally_caught/,stocks,,,

Under the agreement, details of which were released on Monday, JPMorgan will invest $75 million of its own funds for a nearly 3% stake in Perpetua, which is building the largest U.S. antimony mine about 138 miles (222 km) north of Boise, Idaho. The agreement was signed on Sunday and was expected to close on Tuesday. The bank, which holds roughly 20,000 shares of Perpetua currently, according to LSEG data, will also have the option to exercise $42 million in warrants within three years. There are no existing U.S. sources of antimony, which is also used to make solar panels, lubricants, flame retardants and other goods. China, the world's largest antimony miner and processor, blocked exports in late 2024, causing Western manufacturers to scramble for fresh supply. Announced earlier this month, JPMorgan's Security and Resiliency Initiative aims to offset what CEO Jamie Dimon said was the ""painfully clear"" reality ""that the United States has allowed itself to become too reliant on unreliable sources of critical minerals."" ""With this investment, we are supporting a company in an industry critical to national security and American resiliency, precisely the focus of our new initiative,"" said Doug Petno, co-CEO of JPMorgan's commercial and investment bank division. The mine, backed by billionaire investor John Paulson, will supply more than 35% of America's annual antimony needs once it opens by 2028 and also produce 450,000 ounces of gold each year. The dual revenue stream is expected to keep the project financially afloat regardless of any steps by Beijing to sway markets. The site, which is under construction as of last week, has estimated reserves of 148 million pounds of antimony and 6 million ounces of gold. Advertisement · Scroll to continue ""This is all about putting America first again relative to the supply chain, in this case for critical minerals,"" said Jon Cherry, Perpetua's CEO. AGNICO ALSO TO INVEST In addition to the JPMorgan investment, Toronto-based gold miner Agnico Eagle (AEM.TO), opens new tab will invest $180 million in Perpetua for a 6.5% stake and help it develop its Idaho mine. The mine was supported by both former President Joe Biden and President Donald Trump, whose administration earlier this year issued the final necessary permits.

Energy + Payments + Big Data moves this week I’ve been tracking several recent headlines from Google (GOOG), and the timing feels more intentional than random. Within just a short period, Google has announced: • Partnering with NextEra to build a nuclear-powered data center in the U.S. • Working with PayPal to launch a cloud-based agency payment solution for merchants • Upgrading its Bigtable storage layer to handle massive data growth more efficiently Individually, none of these headlines are shocking. But when you look at them together, it seems like Google is building a **full-stack infrastructure strategy** for the future economy: Energy → Dominance in compute power Nuclear-driven data centers reduce reliance on grids and regulatory bottlenecks. Payments → The underlying rails of commerce Controlling payment flows reduces dependence on third-party fintech. Data → The ultimate long-term moat Bigtable upgrades suggest they expect exponential data growth across AI, enterprise cloud, and real-time analytics. Google is no longer just an advertising company. It feels like they’re positioning themselves to become the foundational layer of the entire digital economy.

Short-term capital gain liabilities are levied on any tax lot held for less than 1 year. This liability is taxed at regular federal marginal income tax rates. *Example - a single filer with a regular income of $70,000 falls into the 22% tax rate. So any capital gains up will be taxed at 22%, until that person's total combine income and gains exceeds $103,350 in 2025. Above that amount at the tax rate goes to 24%.* Long-term capital gain liabilities are levied on any tax loss held for more than 1 year. This liability is taxed at special tax rates of 0%, 15%, or 20%. It is calculated based on your total taxable income. *Example - our single filer making $70k will have long-term capital gain liabilities in the 15% bracket. That is true for total income up to $533,400 in 2025.* So the answer really depends on your total income, including wages/salary, capital gains, and all other taxable income. This also does not include any tax liability at the state level....",Yo_Biff,3,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ohxk08/worth_it_to_sell_long_term_stock_to_rebuy_at_a/nlrdaj0/,stocks,,,

Hi guys, hypothetical question. Still learning. If I have a stock that I bought for $10, and it's now at $100 and I've held it for over a year, is it worth it to sell at $100, and rebuy it at $97? Just making sure there's no taxes or other implications I'm not considering that would make it not worth it. EDIT\* Let me add further clarification to the scenario. This would be in a regular taxed account Lets say the stock goes to $102. Would it have been better to keep the original shares and sell at $102. Or is it better to sell at 100, rebuy at 97, and then it goes to 102 and sell. The 97 to 102 would be short term gain",Maximum_Gear1400,0,30,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1ohxk08/worth_it_to_sell_long_term_stock_to_rebuy_at_a/,stocks,,,

[https://imgur.com/a/lFKuMIo](https://imgur.com/a/lFKuMIo) It's very interesting to see how the major world indices have performed in the long term and the shorter term. Some notes I found interesting; * KOSPI is on fire. Combination of strong governance reform and the top 2 stocks in the index being heavy memory chip plays is a potent combination. * A lot of European indices have been good performers in the 1 year and 5 year timeframe. Not surprising on the shorter timeframe especially given currency and defense, but the 5 year is. * India has had a horrid 3 years that has substantially dragged down the longer term track record. * Japan and Korea has had strong 1 year returns due to corporate governance reforms. HK/China is tracking at the same pace due to government re-embracing the private sector.",Educational_Pop6138,2,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1oi0bwu/performance_of_major_global_indices_rebased_to_usd/,stocks,,,

Its acquisition of Cloud Light further strengthens its portfolio and accelerates future growth potential.

I have a vehicle with 105k miles. Its present trade in value would be $13,000, I owe $7,500 on it. I want to compare it to the cost of a new vehicle over the same 36 month time period. Let’s put aside costs of anticipated maintenance and repairs, sales tax, and interest costs for the purpose of this discussion, I will factor them into the final analysis. Let’s assume that I will need to liquidate the current vehicle in 36 months when, due to accumulated mileage, it will become inconvenient and uneconomical to own. In 36 months my vehicle will be worth $5,000. Therefore it will depreciate $8,000 during that period, amortized to $222 per month. I could pay off the $7,500 loan balance right now - setting aside time value of money, that amortizes to $208 per month.

In the case of stock-based compensation (SBC), new shares are created and distributed to employees. If this is not offset by share buybacks, then existing shareholders' equity will be diluted. If a company has 100 shares worth $10/each, the market cap is $1000. If I own 10 shares, my equity is $100 (10% of the company). The company decides to pay 10 shares to their employees as stock-based compensation. The value stays constant at $1000, but the share count has increased to 110. That means each share is now worth $9.09/share. The total value of my shares has decreased to $90.90 (9.09%). My share count did not change, but my ownership was diluted by almost 10%. SBC can be combined with share buybacks, so that existing owners are not diluted. If a company repurchases 10 shares and gives out 10 shares to employees, the net effect on existing owners is 0. Existing shareholders are not better or worse off. Most big companies do both share buybacks and SBC, but their buybacks will be greater than their SBC",AlfredoAllenPoe,3,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1mntqiz/american_companies_are_buying_their_own_stocks_at/n8gqvjq/,finance,,,

Buybacks can be a signal that leads to higher stock prices but they can also do the opposite. L The main purpose of buybacks is to reduce share count and assuming earnings remain constant EPS increases. If the multiple remains constant, the share price increases commiserately with the buyback, providing a yield (assuming investors sell shares on a pro rata basis consistent with the buyback). When earnings are increasing, the boost to EPS is even higher. Buybacks can also be viewed as a signal from management that they expect earnings to grow so short term share price may increase in response to new buyback announcements (less so for recurring buybacks). Buybacks are just another type of shareholder capital return similar to dividends. The only difference is there are different tax treatments (some positive and others negative) but most importantly the optionally of the investor regarding when they realize the income (dividends decide that for you while buybacks allow choice).",insightful_pancake,7,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1mntqiz/american_companies_are_buying_their_own_stocks_at/n8cib6h/,finance,,,

It's also because capital flight got progressively easier. The norm level between countries changed because of the reduced threat of proletarian organization around an idea — and, countries also found themselves having to compete against each other to attract investment. The latter is a vicious spiral: countries with e.g. low corp. tax rates can't invest in their economies, which undermines the reasons why capital would flow to those economies in the first place; this leaves those countries with nothing to compete on to attract capital except for lowered corp. tax rates. Meanwhile, countries that already invest in their economies and see the benefit from doing so don't have to lower their tax rates to compete so much, because capital will readily fly to an economy in which investment has already occured. But those latter countries are fragile. One wrong step or exogenous shock and capital will fly. And then there's little for those countries to do but e.g. lower tax rates. If they invest instead as usual, capital investors will point out that such investment didn't preclude the wrong step or the shock. Reduced tax rates, however, are valuable to investors right here, right now.",highbrowalcoholic,4,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1myyvev/the_twilight_of_the_central_banking_elite/naklqf1/,finance,,,

Tidjane Thiam, once a prominent figure in global finance, has found himself in that position after a court in his native Ivory Coast barred him from standing in October’s presidential election. Côte d’Ivoire is the world’s biggest producer of cocoa beans and has had several years of strong economic growth, but its octogenarian leader, Alassane Ouattara, is now running for a controversial fourth term. Thiam, 63, is left sitting out the campaign in France, fearing arrest if he returns home. He is, however, no stranger to setbacks: A previous stint in the Ivorian government was ended by a 1999 coup d’état. In business, too, Thiam rose to the top — running two Fortune 500 companies over 11 years — before his tenure as chief executive officer of Credit Suisse was cut short by a corporate-espionage scandal.

If not, it hurts returns. Even when leverage helps the return, as you noticed, it reduces the total $ you receive. That’s an important insight that many people miss. So why leverage? investors tend to care much more about percentages and multiples of investment than gross $. Basically, the idea is that there are lots of opportunities out there. So in the lemonade stand example, if you had $100 to invest, you actually could buy TWO lemonade stands if you use the debt and only put $50 in each one. Therefore you’d make $180 instead of $100 on a total $100 equity investment.",roboboom,2,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1nbew1u/moronic_monday_september_08_2025_your_weekly/ndpfldy/,finance,,,

ndgzic2,reddit_comment,2025-09-10 16:19:29+00:00,2025-10-28 12:51:01+00:00,,"This isn't a very good video; misleading at worst and confusing at best. What you should know is that debt does not let you as a shareholder make more profit in all cases, only when the business is growing. If the business is flagging, taking on debt actually makes you lose more as a shareholder than if you didn't incur any debt to begin with. That's why debt is also known as leverage, it amplifies the end result when you have it. I'll try to condense the gist of his video in a very simple example. Let's say you wanted to start a lemonade stand - the wood for the stand, cardboard signage, and the jug and cups cost $100 in total. You break your piggy bank and use $100 from your savings to set up the stand, which over a period nets you $300 in lemonade sales (evidently you're a lemonade wunderkind) and after paying for the lemons, sugar and water that go into your lemonade, you have made $200 in profit. So essentially you invested $100 of your own money and now you're collecting $200 in profit, or a decent return of two times your money. But let's say you didn't use $100, because your dad loaned you $50 at 20% interest, which is a cost to you for borrowing the money. Now you only have to put in $50 of your own money to set up the stand which costs $100. After a year, you make the same $200 in profit and after you subtract the $10 interest ($50 x 20%), you still net a cool $190 by just using $50 of your own money, which is now a return of 3.8x instead of 2x like in the earlier example.

It's doubtful that after 10 years, your salary also nearly doubled. Maybe it's increased 20%. So over the course of those 10 years, your buying power is going to decrease dramatically because things cost 80% more, but you only make 20% more. If the cost of everything doubled today, and you only made 20% more than you currently make, you'd be much worse off. Well that's what cutting interest rates will mean for future you.

He is far too taken with the rich crooks who defrauded the little people.

Billions, the drama series co-created by Sorkin, never dealt with the non-rich and non-powerful and it was entertaining. But a historical nonfiction book like 1929 which leaves out the suffering of the masses, many of whom had no stocks, in the aftermath of the crash and basically just avoids talking about the human tragedy of the Great Depression, seems like a worthless exercise. Sorkin’s view is that over time, the market works — and he is uninterested in the little guys, the average Joes and Janes who are the victims of the millionaire bankers and traders he seems to idolize.

nhonyx7,reddit_comment,2025-10-04 08:01:12+00:00,2025-10-28 12:51:02+00:00,,"Reliving the **1929 crash** isn’t about predicting another Great Depression — it’s about understanding how **human behavior in markets rarely changes**. In 1929, stock prices were driven by **speculation, easy credit, and a belief that “this time is different.”** Margin debt was sky-high, valuations disconnected from fundamentals, and retail investors flooded the market chasing quick gains. When confidence cracked, leverage turned small corrections into total collapse. Fast forward to today — the economy, regulations, and monetary tools are very different, but the *psychology* feels familiar at times. Periods like the 2021–22 tech bubble or the 2024 AI rally show how **narrative-driven markets** can detach from earnings reality. Liquidity, not logic, often drives price moves in the short run. The key lesson from 1929 isn’t “markets always crash,” but that **excessive leverage, herd behavior, and ignoring valuation risk** eventually reset expectations. Central banks can cushion the fall now, but they can’t repeal cycles of greed and fear. If anything, the 1929 story reminds investors to: * Respect **risk management** — downturns always come faster than expected. * Avoid **speculative leverage** — margin works both ways. * Focus on **long-term fundamentals**, not hype. History doesn’t repeat, but it rhymes. Every bull market starts with innovation and ends with euphoria. Understanding 1929 helps us spot when optimism starts to turn into overconfidence — and when to quietly step aside before the music stops.",Manas-raj-06,1,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1nmv5e2/what_reliving_the_1929_crash_tells_us_about/nhonyx7/,finance,,,

You can pop the popcorn and watch rich men twisting in the lies they tell themselves and others. Or you can read 1929 to match the stories Wall Street told itself then to those of today, a perversely fun project that Sorkin subtly leaves us to complete for ourselves. Both approaches are worthwhile. Neither will task your brain. That’s because Sorkin, one of America’s highest-profile financial journalists — with twin seats at CNBC and the New York Times — does not seek to explain why the stock market fever rose and broke. It was FOMO plus debt. It’s almost always FOMO plus debt. Nor does he offer a counternarrative about how the mania could have been avoided. (“No matter how many warnings are issued or how many laws are written,” he writes, “people will find new ways to believe that the good times can last forever.”) He isn’t trying to explain the Great Depression, or whether the crash caused it. But in the current moment, when so much feels (and is!) unprecedented, Sorkin’s greatest accomplishment is allowing us to relive precedent by re-creating how the market felt in 1929, week by week, sometimes day by day, to those experiencing it as its own thing before they knew how it would live on in history.

It's easy to commoditize compute, which is why Amazon did so in like 2009 with their EC2 Spot product, named after spot pricing on financial markets. It's very hard to commoditize compute that needs to work on specific data sets, due to something the tech industry calls ""data gravity."" This idea encodes the financial and performance costs of moving data around. Basically, if your data exists in a particular place like a certain cloud datacenter region, there's a large advantage in also performing computation on it in that same place. While it's technically feasible to process it elsewhere, it's harder in terms of both cost, performance, and expensive human effort to design the system to do so. There's a bunch of other friction like data sovereignty regulation, too. The only economically useful workloads are ones that combine compute with interesting data. So the idea of just commoditizing compute without having a solution for data gravity is just econ majors theorizing. And if one had a solution for data gravity, one would be very, very rich.

Oracle Corp., meanwhile, recently added some $250 billion to its market capitalization overnight after revealing the size of its upcoming order book.

Each $ of revenue adds 25x to Nvidia (they have a $4Tn market cap off $160bn revenue). So while this didn't increase the market cap of Nvidia (it just converted some cash into investments so it's value neutral), it did secure continued demand from their most important customer. Nvidia only has a handful of customers so losing $300bn from OpenAI could have illustratively crated their share price by over $1Tn. This compute thing is more worrying because financial wizards will make new, potentially dangerous instruments with this, market demand will be excessive, and if there was capacity overbuild in DCs, which we might only realise it in a year or two, it could devastate this market.

The company fully depreciates all its rental cars over five years using the straight-line method. The new cars are expected to generate $225,000 per year in earnings before taxes and depreciation for five years. The company is entirely financed by equity and has a 21 percent tax rate. The required return on the company’s unlevered equity is 14 percent and the new fleet will not change the risk of the company. The risk-free rate is 8 percent. a. What is the maximum price that the company should be willing to pay for the new fleet of cars if it remains an all-equity company? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your answer to 2 decimal places, e.g., 32.16.) b. Suppose the company can purchase the fleet of cars for $700,000. Additionally, assume the company can issue $450,000 of five-year debt to finance the project at the risk-free rate of 8 percent. All principal will be repaid in one balloon payment at the end of the fifth year. What is the APV of the project? (Do not round intermediate calculations and round your answer to 2 decimal places, e.g., 32.16.) Not sure if I should use 225,000/5 for depreciation, or calculate the Vu and use that /5 instead?

Corporate bond issuance is booming, yields are stabilizing, and investors are pouring money into riskier debt — all signs of confidence. But that’s exactly what’s making Wall Street uneasy. When the **credit market “hums” too smoothly**, it usually means risk perception is muted. Spreads between safe and risky debt narrow, and everyone assumes refinancing or new issuance will stay easy forever. That’s great until liquidity tightens or macro data weakens — then all that complacency unwinds fast. Right now, we’re seeing: * **Strong demand** for corporate and high-yield bonds (even with higher rates). * **Companies refinancing early**, locking in long-term debt before the next tightening cycle. * **Investors chasing yield**, especially as equity valuations feel stretched. The concern is that this calm might hide **credit risk buildup**. If growth slows or inflation reaccelerates, defaults could spike, especially in lower-rated corporate debt. Add geopolitical tension or another policy shock, and liquidity could vanish overnight. In short, Wall Street’s nervous because a “perfect” credit market can flip suddenly. Credit is the real heartbeat of the economy — when it’s steady, everything looks fine; when it stumbles, equities and risk assets follow.

Plus it’s an opaque market…kind of funny how the Fed & OCC over regulating banks has pushed pension fund and investor capital into an unregulated opaque industry… The real trend WSJ should focus on is how there just isn’t enough deal making to satiate the overwhelming supply of investor capital, which driving spreads down and turning the PC market into one that looks awfully like the broadly syndicated market.",johnsonutah,12,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1nto9cc/wsj_the_credit_market_is_hummingand_that_has_wall/ngxfnet/,finance,,,

Investors are gobbling up corporate debt like it is going out of style—even though the rewards, by some measures, are lower than they have been in decades. The frothy mood has some on Wall Street worried that the market is priced for perfection and ripe for a fall. >That is why any bad news is touching a nerve and raising the question of whether something more profound is ailing American borrowers. Two sudden bankruptcies in the auto world—of a subprime lender and a parts supplier—have triggered those conversations among bond investors and analysts. >So far, there is no sign of wider fallout—and each of those situations had unique characteristics that don’t point to broader trends. But combined with other challenges, such as persistent inflation and rising defaults in a hot Wall Street segment known as “private credit,” it is enough to give longtime traders pause. [...] >One concern is that lending to riskier borrowers has been growing for years, first through traditional bonds and loans, then in the form of private credit and the revival of complex asset-backed debt. The longer that credit boom lasts, the more likely it is that defaults will rise. Likewise, the higher the valuations of corporate bonds and loans, the more susceptible they become to selloffs. >The fate of the market could depend on the direction of the economy. Some investors note that the current benign environment could continue if inflation pressures ease and there is no further deterioration in the labor market, allowing the Federal Reserve to boost economic activity by cutting interest rates and relieving pressure on borrowers. [...] >The overarching concern on Wall Street is that the exceptionally high valuations for corporate debt are concealing excesses in the market and insufficiently compensating investors for taking risks. >That is visible in the paltry additional yield, or spread, that investors are getting by holding investment-grade corporate bonds compared with ultrasafe U.S. Treasurys. That figure fell to 0.74 percentage point in September, its lowest level since 1998, according to ICE Data Indices. The spread for junk-rated bonds is about 2.75 percentage points, near the record low set in 2007. [...] >An increasing number of companies that took out private credit loans, especially smaller enterprises, lack the cash to make interest payments on their debts. Instead they have started issuing the equivalent of IOUs to their creditors, replacing cash interest with “payment-in-kind,” or PIK, distributions. >About 11% of all loans by business-development companies, or BDCs—a growing category of private-credit funds—were receiving PIK interest income at the end of 2024, even before the threat of tariffs sowed uncertainty among U.S. companies, according to S&P Global Ratings. >More concerning, private credit defaults, which spiked during the pandemic but had started to subside since then, have been on the rise. Fitch’s privately monitored rating default rate hit 9.5% in July, before receding slightly.",ntbananas,18,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1nto9cc/wsj_the_credit_market_is_hummingand_that_has_wall/ngv122h/,finance,,,

If Europe increased domestic demand by driving consumers inward with a weaker currency on the global stage, they could be more financially resilient to external shocks in the worst case, while simultaneously making their exports more competitive to fight China.

Next month my family of 5 will be taking a vacation 3 years in the making, the only thing left to purchase are Disney Workd tickets. My wife and I made a decision a while ago after some foolish spending not to put anything in credit cards, so she has been setting aside 10% of her pay checks for 3 years now from her part time job with JetBlue in an ESPP program that twice a year allows her to buy JetBlue stock at a 15% discount. The idea was to use this money to buy our theme park tickets and some spending money. Well the stock price has steadily gone down in that time which, while it has allowed her to buy more shares, now outs in a position of not wanting to really “sell low”. Our other option to fund our trip would be to take out some money from a HELOC that we have had open and have been paying in for years. The HELOC is a 30 year loan at the current prime rate. So my question is this: Option A - sell the JetBlue stock at its current price and use that money for what we need for our trip, we should get about 9k from the sell or.. if we do this, we pay for our trip completely without any debt and not take from our HELOC and increase our monthly debt payment. Option B - leave the stock and wait for it to recover, take the money from the HELOC and when the stock recovers to a better price and sell to cover what we used for the trip. As an additional strategy for option B, we could continue the 10% deductions for years until it forms a really nice amount.

I did my undergrad in Political Science, Economics, and Mathematics (I originally entered as a poli-sci major), and I’m now in the final semester of my master’s in Mathematics. I’m at a well-regarded university in Asia, and my research focuses on optimization and control theory. I’ve completed two optimal control projects with a government research institute, have one paper under review on convergence proofs for multi-agent control, and another almost ready for submission on a closed-form solution to a newsvendor optimization problem. I thought my research record was decent, and since my work could apply to things like robotics or autonomous systems (e.g., path optimization), I’ve been applying to manufacturing-related companies. But so far, I’m only getting about one interview out of seven applications. I wasn’t originally interested in finance, but I’ve started applying to quant positions as well — and one of my professors is recommending me for a quant role through his connections. Still, I’m a bit worried. Quants are known for being *really* smart, and I’m not sure I’d be able to keep up. How strong is a typical quant’s intuition? For instance, when it comes to minimizing loss — do they immediately see how to adjust the loss function or which regularization technique to add? Like, do those ideas just come naturally to them at a glance? I wouldn’t say my intuition is especially sharp — I tend to think things through slowly and methodically. That’s actually why I’ve been leaning more toward manufacturing or applied engineering roles, where the pace feels a bit less cutthroat.",Pale_Opportunity_585,1,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1o5as1r/moronic_monday_october_13_2025_your_weekly/njxxnem/,finance,,,

Assuming I don't know anything about business and this field, and my only motivating factor being: to earn money and to learn more about money ( as I would say I'm finicially illiterate), should I pursue finance? What is the future like?",tanshuu,1,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1o5as1r/moronic_monday_october_13_2025_your_weekly/njewufd/,finance,,,

That already puts you ahead of most people who just choose something without self-reflection. Finance can be a really good field if you’re curious about how money works, how businesses grow, and how people build wealth. But it’s not just about earning money it’s about understanding systems, markets, and behavior. If that kind of thing starts to interest you, you’ll probably enjoy the journey......switching from psychology to finance doesn’t mean you’re abandoning one for the other. in fact, psychology and finance overlap a lot more than people think. Behavioral finance, for example, studies how emotions and cognitive biases affect money decisions. If you liked psychology, that side of finance might really click with you.",Optionslab,3,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1o5as1r/moronic_monday_october_13_2025_your_weekly/njg4btv/,finance,,,

Wealth once you have enough of it can generate significant income. But while it’s just sitting in an account accumulating it’s not doing anything besides being a number. Since it’s not doing anything it doesn’t really have much bearing on your life especially if you don’t have enough income to do the things you want to do and especially if you do t have enough income to feel secure. 20k in euros/pounds/dollars is enough to bail you out in many emergencies and so you you can derive a degree of security from that. But it’s no where near enough to generate any real income. You probably also know how hard it will be to reaccumulate it if you spend it. So knowing it’s there in an emergency is a double edged sword, you know you can use it but you also know the price of doing so. It’s better than not having it but it’s still stress. So it’s understandable that you don’t feel any difference. Keep saving eventually you’ll have enough that it really will make a difference.

Certainly, some saved up buffer is a nice security blanket and can alleviate some stress of making ends meet. But at the same time, you could have a hundred thousand, or a million quid or more, and feel lost or miserable in life or battling all sorts of issues. There's no magical bridge one crosses at a certain savings amount. But if you saved your first 10k and moved to 20k, that's great progress. I have faith you can get to 40k. It's like weight loss; if you can lose 1 pound you can lose 2. If you can lose 2 you can lose 4. So long as you stick with a steady process. With regards to your job and future career path, that's a bit of a separate topic. But if it's any consolation, everyone wonders where their life is heading at 24.

Realistically £20k isn't going to make your life easier, nor will £100k if we're going to be honest. Invested wealth doesn't make life easier now, it makes it easier later, when you're approaching your life goals. Focus on your career and increasing your earning potential now. Focus on saving and growing your investments, and set goals for when you want to retire, and what you'll do and how much you need to make that happen. Having £20k does make things emotionally easier for you, if you realize you now have a safety cushion should your fortunes turn sour for awhile.

I’ve watched almost every video and read countless posts about personal growth, finance, and budgeting. A common message I keep hearing is that “life starts to get easier once you make your first £10K.” Well, I’m now over £20K invested but honestly, life doesn’t feel any easier. I’m still working a low-salary job that doesn’t inspire me, and I don’t feel like I have any strong or marketable skills yet. I’m 24 and starting to wonder where my life is heading. For those of you who’ve passed this stage once you hit your first £10K (or more), what actually changed for you? Did new opportunities open up? Did your mindset shift in a real, tangible way? Or did things stay the same until you made bigger moves?

I wouldn’t personally trade that for a riskier better payoff. I would consider taking a portion of the rental income and building positions for income. I’d consider either a covered call ETF portfolio that pays regular distributions or changing your strategy for options to the wheel strategy so you are selling calls or puts on an underlying of your choice.

It is a 2 bed/1bath at 1200 square feet in what I would call a B- neighborhood. The home had a 15 year mortgage taken out in 2012 and has about $15k in principle left. Rental income is currently at $1495/month. averaging the various online real estate sites and looking at recent sales I'd estimate the current sales value at around $225k. The roof, HVAC, and fence are all less than 5 years old, so if we do continue to rent, we should be clear of any large CAPEX items for several years. When we pay off the home in 2027, assuming we are still at $1495 per month, after taxes and insurance it comes out to $977 (again, assuming T&I doesnt keep rising at a ridiculous rate). Accounting for management, vacancy, repairs and future CAPEX I am calculating around $560 per month. Assuming 2% annual appreciation, that adds another $375/month (first year) for a total of $960/month. If I were to sell the home today at the $225k, after realtor fees, depreciation recapture, taxes, mortgage pay off, capital gains, minor repairs etc, I am coming up with around $175k in cash. Now for my theory: say I take this $175k and add some savings to get to $203k so I can buy 300 shares of SPY at its current trading price of $677. Tracking this for a bit, I can sell 0.25 delta covered calls that are one week out for around $1.75 each. This would put the gross income at $525/week, not accounting for any appreciation. I don't need to show the math to prove that this comes out to higher than the $960/month from my rental. two outcomes of this weekly position: 1. SPY increases past my strike. I roll the option into the following week, profit is locked up in the sell/buy but still a net increase. 2. SPY trades below my strike by whatever amount and I just keep the premium. There are of course pros and cons to both options. An obvious risk to point out with the CC option is that the market could plummet at any point and my $200k could fall to $100k or lower. If, in theory, I do not plan to cash out this position and spend it anytime within the next couple decades (similar to holding the cash in the rental equity) I'm not concerned over that other than the income from the premiums would shrink as well. There are also obvious cons to the rental that are not captured in the $960 above as well. A bad tenant, liability, extended vacancy, reduction in rent (probably tied to the market 'crash' scenario above) all could impact the profitability. I have also looked into selling this property or pulling a HELOC to buy other rentals. At the current values and interest rates I just can't get any properties I come across to make sense at all. I am open to other suggestions or pointing out of pitfalls or other details I am not considering.

The only way to write another call option would be to buy the security again - a security that is now worth more than what you just sold it for. How can that be sustainable? Surely the value of the fund will diminish over time. Yet for some funds like JEPI the NAV has remained flat or even grown.

Especially during bull market runs. If you write a covered call and then have to sell the security you wrote it against then you’ll need to buy that security back - likely at a higher price than you sold it for - to continue to write covered calls. If you’re paying out the premiums to fund owners in the form of a dividend distribution then where is the money coming from to continue this strategy? Additional investor capital? Surely over time these funds will wither away?

It is for fun essentially, and also does provide further diversification) 3.3% in BRK.B (This is the one I feel like I should know better than to hold so much in a single stock. But like the bitcoin etf I will not buy more if it drops. I like the aspect of cash and concentrating more heavily on US stocks as far as the equity portion. The remaining 41% will currently be in SNSXX (I have high state taxes) as I intend to purchase a home and potentially start a business in the near future. Once those purchases are finalized, I will keep a much smaller amount in an emergency fund and redistribute the rest into BND and VT So after the house/business I aim to hold 80% VT and 20% BND, disregarding the fbtc, brkb, and snsxx as these will not be rebalanced. Some concerns I have. As I am self employed with minimal income the entire portfolio is currently in a taxable account. I know self employment IRAs exist but they wont do me much good as my holdings significantly overshadow my income. While I am comfortable with the current percentage allocation to the more volatile BRK.B and significantly more volatile FBTC in the current break down, these percentages will nearly double when my SNSXX gets spent so I suppose I ought to accept that or factor in my property value as part of my portfolio, however this is a home I intend to live in, and am not actually considering it as a financial investment that I anticipate or expect growth from. I would prefer to invest actually in government bonds themselves than BND and leave the corporates behind especially when I diminish my MM, but haven't gotten around to organizing for that yet. I am also interested in short term Indian bonds or CDs but have not found a way to do this yet. The cash for this would come from any remainder of SNSXX. Despite my aim at set-and-forget/long term growth, due to my insufficient income, I would like to retain the option to make some yearly withdrawals of about ~1% of my portfolio in difficult years. I am not sure where to take it from though and if it would make sense to rather keep this money in an annuity or short term CDs because it is my hope that I don't need to actually touch the portfolio (besides SNSXX) for about 30+ years",Ok-Run6662,0,4,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ogsk2k/looking_for_feedback_on_my_investment_plan/,investing,,,

II also has a separate app for its “community” which is like a chat site of investors and gives you a lot of insight into other portfolios - if you want investment to become more of a hobby. I think it’s important to take tax into account but not be tax driven. Ultimately it’s return that matters but on the whole I try and only use the GIA for low yielding funds but some of my funds do generate average levels of yields because I like the funds! One example of a growth focused fund that has a low yield would be Fidelity Index World P Acc fund which has a yield of only 1.2%. It’s a huge fund (>£12 billion), low cost (0.12%) and it tracks a global index so is pretty well diversified. I used to own it but personally I don’t like having so much US exposure so I sold out 6 months ago. Another interesting fund is Orbis OEIC Global Balanced fund which is a blend of equities and bonds (currently 83% equites and 17% bonds/commodities). This aims to produce high growth but at lower risk than a pure equity fund. Its yield is 0% so there isn’t an Inc version of it. It’s a smaller fund (but still a healthy £1.3 billion). It’s actively managed rather than passively following a market index. I’ve recently bought this. Essentially, you have lots of choice - perhaps too much choice! Good luck!

My strategy in using my GIA was to invest in growth focused low yielding Acc funds/ETFs. That way you minimise income tax and you can chose when to expose yourself to lower rates of CGT. If you’re a higher rate taxpayer then CGT is 24% v 40% of income tax on dividends. If you’re a standard rate tax payer it’s less of an issue (18% CGT v 20% income tax). Of course you also have a £3k CGT tax allowance to use ( as most likely you have fully used any income tax allowances). I do have a couple of ETFs but they add a little bit of extra admin as you have to searching for the ERI data - but it’s not a big deal. My platform provides an annual tax statement for my GIA and this provides all the data you need for Acc OEIC funds (ie dividends reinvested, equalisation payments) but it doesn’t provide data on ETFs - annoying but I only have 2. You’re right that the income tax position on Inc and Acc funds is the same. But if you chose the Inc version and reinvest, your CGT tax calculation is slightly more simple as it’s slightly easier to track the book cost but it’s really not that difficult for Acc funds as you use your platforms annual tax statements and manually add the dividends reinvested to your book cost (if you don’t do this then you will overlay CGT). But overall I aim for low yielding Acc/ETFs as I can then control when I pay tax and I pay a lower rate. Your tax statement should show the dividends and equalisation amounts separately as these are treated differently for tax purposes. Dividends are income whereas the equalisation payment is (as you say) a return of capital which reduces your book cost (so ultimately it will increase your CGT when you sell). You need to track both of these. But equalisation payments only happen once, in the period you buy (they adjust for the fact that you will get a full period dividend regardless of the timing of your purchase. So if you buy the day before the dividend is distributed you will have a bigger equalisation receipt then if you buy the day after the dividend is distributed….reflecting a fair entitlement to the dividend).",VoteDoughnuts,1,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ogt0ad/question_for_uk_based_members_advice_on_holding/nlm67oc/,investing,,,

I recently inherited £100,000 from a relative who very sadly passed away. I have maxed out both my ISA and SIPP contributions for this year, but I want to get this money working for me in a Fund right away. Over the coming years, I can slowly move this money into my tax-sheltered accounts, but for now my only option is to have it in a GIA. I would like to keep things as simple and efficient as possible from a Tax perspective. From the research I have done so far: it looks as if the best way of achieving this (inside a GIA) would be to buy an OEIC that distributes income, such as the Vanguard FTSE Global All Cap Index Fund (VFGAIGI). One reason for my thinking that an OEIC would be preferable to an ETF (inside a GIA), is that an ETF would have ERI (Excess reportable income) to report each year, however an OEIC will not have ERI to report. Is this correct? The reason that I think that a distributing income fund would be preferable, is that if and when I sell any of the fund, my CGT calculations would be much more straight-forward. Please correct me on this if I am wrong, but my research so far seems to show the following: In a Distributing income fund, I will receive my dividends and pay tax on them each year. I can then choose to either keep them for myself, or manually re-invest them into the fund. And that is the end of that. However, in an Accumulating fund, I will still have to pay tax on the dividends that will accumulate in the fund each year. When I come to sell part/all of the fund in the years down the line, in order to calculate the CGT correctly, I would have to keep a record of every dividend that I received and paid tax on. These dividends would then be added to the base price of the fund, and this would in turn reduce my CGT accordingly. While this doesn’t seem too arduous a task – it is another still thing to remember, and another calculation to make. Would I be correct in thinking that if I choose to manually reinvest all of my dividends in a Distributing income fund, then I would ultimately be in the same position (financially) as I would be if I had chosen an accumulating fund – but with the bonus of a very simple CGT calculation later on when I come to sell the fund? Asides from this, are there any other differences between having an accumulating or income OEIC in a GIA? I have also done some reading on Equalisation for when I come to calculate CGT later on. As this is basically a return of Capital which is included in a Dividend payment; on the Tax statement that I'd receive from my investment platform (I'm considering Vanguard Investor) - would this show the Dividend amount, minus the Equalisation payment? Thereby ensuring that I only pay Dividend tax in my self-assessment on the actual amount of dividend I have earned while in the fund, and not on the return of capital/equalisation? I would be very grateful for any advice, and thanks to all for reading.",dreamsofyou8,1,3,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ogt0ad/question_for_uk_based_members_advice_on_holding/,investing,,,

If say you want to hold an ETF similar to VT, you can do it via US broker, via Ireland, Singapore, etc and see very different picture in terms of commissions, taxes, and protection. If you want more protection and distance, you could also have a trust in a neutral jurisdiction. So having several brokers in the same country makes no difference to anything.

The governments of countries around the world incentives local market by offering preferential tax treatment to local equities or by taxing foreign investments at a higher rate. This incentivizes locals to invest locally and juice the local market. Meanwhile foreign investors like us don’t get tax breaks for these stocks so we’re basically paying a premium.

I'm Canadian and the recommendation for most people here is to diversify globally between Canada, US, Europe, and the rest of the world. I know historically US companies have done better but it's foolish to assume that will always be the case. Of course you want your portfolio to skew towards your country of residence as you'll be most affected by economic changes in that country, but being globally diversified is important. By doing this you also indirectly gain exposure to other currencies which is good to protect against potential devaluation of your country's currency. IMO the biggest benefit to being globally diversified is you're protected against a future in which your home country gets surpassed by others economically and your buying power becomes non-existent in those countries which makes mobility harder (among other things).",felixthecatmeow,15,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oh5rhs/those_of_you_sitting_on_a_large_cash_position/nlnl17o/,investing,,,

Those 500 companies pull in revenue from every corner of the globe, so owning the index gives you exposure to growth worldwide without the headaches of currency swings or foreign governance risks that come with pure international funds. That said, I do suggest adding a broad international ETF like VEU for extra diversity, but keep it to 10-20% of the portfolio at most. The goal there is simple diversification, not a bet that US dominance will fade anytime soon. In our lifetimes, the odds of that shift seem low. The S&P 500 has a genuine moat. As nations modernize, they don’t just copy American tech; they become customers of it. Think cloud services, software, chips, pharmaceuticals, all dominated by S&P names. Beyond the companies themselves, the US political system and legal framework actively foster innovation and startups in ways most countries still struggle to match. Shareholder rights, capital access, bankruptcy laws that don’t punish failure, all of it feeds a cycle that keeps producing world-leading firms. So yes, there’s some home bias, but it’s more than that.

Find contracts with 30-35 days of expiration. Find a put with a delta of less than .30. Sell 1 put only if the premium your going to get is at least 1%. Anything less it isnt worth it and should find another stock. Around day 15 theta decay should kick in and the put will start giving you your gains back quickly because of the rise and or fall in price through the day. If the put expires in ITM meaning the stock price has fallen below your strike price. You will have to purchase the 100 shares at the agreed upon strike price. If it expires OTM meaning stock price has stayed above your strike. You keep all your cash + the premium you got when you sold the PUT. It's a good way to get into a stock at a specific price you want and wait till it gets there. You essentially are paid a premium to insure the entire downside of 100 shares on a stock. You should only do this on stocks you want to own.,cephpleb,49,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oh5rhs/those_of_you_sitting_on_a_large_cash_position/nlm4nhl/,investing,,,

I have about $75k in cash. My estimated expenses are $64,000 per year and this does not include my car payment. This amount covers just the basics--I do not buy myself fancy things or take vacations. I do not have any retirement accounts. I do not have any children. I was Self-Employed for the earlier part of my life and a majority of my money and income was earned by helping my parents build a small collection of rental properties. Due to health issues we are discussing the liquidation of all assets and having them give (gift) them to me. I estimate that the total value of these assets, after taxes, to be approximately $2.75M. We do not think that the assets can be maintained until death for the step-up in basis to be beneficial. I would additionally need to rely on these assets for fairly immediate income. Since I am still fairly young, I'm not really interested in dealing with IRA or investment accounts. I value my ability to add and manage this money as freely as possible without having to worry about contribution limits or early withdrawals. I estimate that I would need to earn $72,000 per year, pre-tax, and adjusted for inflation for this to last me the rest of my life. I also estimate that this represents a return of approximately 5.25% on the total 2.75M First and foremost, I am sincerely thankful for my parents and our close relationship. None of this would have been possible without their financial prudence. While this situation was always an agreement that we had they very well could have just used the money for their own enjoyment. Thanks Mom and Dad. Second--I DO NOT WANT TO BLOW THIS! I understand that I can just put it all into Money Market funds but with those returns I am guaranteed to dip into the principle and I want to do everything that I can to live off of this money and not just draw from it. The last thing I want to do is start eating away at the golden goose that's intended to provide me with a steady stream of monthly eggs. I will be speaking with financial advisors but I am always worried, even as fiducaries, that they will be pushing me into products and services with overly-optomistic outcomes. It would take time for me to find employment and while I am willing to do so for a few years, I know that doing so would not be enough to cover my regular monthly expenses. Ideally, I don't want to ~have~ to work ever again. How do I preserve this nest egg? How feasible is a low-risk 5.25%? How do I manage the immediate period between investment and the $64,000 expenses that I have each year? Any suggestions or advice? Pitfalls? The last thing I want to do is lose any of this money! Finally, the $64,000 figure is pretty firm. Any attempt to significantly reduce this figure would involve moving and downsizing. It would be significantly easier and less risky for me to pick up a job at Wegman's than to try and reduce my expenses if that is something that would be required to help preserve capital.",Jealous_Yesterday_67,1,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oh8kty/daily_general_discussion_and_advice_thread/nlqytw8/,investing,,,

On the SSD side AI is soaking up a lot of additional capacity besides the usual cyclical demand from client and data center upgrades. On top of that, none of the players appear in a hurry to add additional production capacity. This supply side discipline is somewhat unprecedented. In case you haven't noticed, everyone is raising prices 10% at minimum and their stocks are all hitting ATH. Analysts are predicting a 10 year super cycle for memory.

There are names that I like long-term where I have a cost basis that's much lower. I have gradually trimmed some, might trim some more if they go materially higher but will get to a comfortable level where I'll keep the rest. There are some small/smaller positions that have ramped in recent months where I have sold because they've gone up considerably and I have no plans near these levels to add further. The money has been re-deployed to various real asset names, things that I thought were more out of favor than they should be (ISRG an example recently, which then had solid earnings shortly after) and other situations (HON, which I don't think will have GE-esque success after the upcoming spin-offs, but I do think that there's upside over the next year as the company breaks itself up.) I have materially less tech exposure than I did a couple years ago but still a good deal of ""ai-adjacent"" power/industrial names. In early 2024, I decided to focus more on ""where the money is being spent"" than ""who is spending the money"" and that's worked out. I've found some moderately good opportunities lately in what's not done as well this year/been out of favor. There's a lot that's popular that I'd add to/add back, but not unless it pulled back significantly. It's been a good year and 2022/early 2025 where people gave a lot of gains back weren't that long ago.

Everyone tries to compare in general to the Dotcom craze of companies like [pets.com](http://pets.com), etc. but as then and now, equipment suppliers were driving the frenzy - NVDA, AMD, ARM will stabilize out - giving good returns but the greatest impact to humanity will be data houses. We got a bubble and it will burst in 2-3 years as equipment sales will lag at some point. In my opinion, the generational winners will be companies with the largest datasets will prevail - GOOG=BIDU > APPL> AMZN=BABA > MSFT=META but there will also be industry specific players (like healthcare, i.e., drug discovery , possibly UNH or research hospital like MSK or Duke Univ), defense maybe PLTR, travel = BKNG, retail (specifically grocery) - any large chains with loyalty programs (they know a lot about you and your preference) or TSLA has more driving data, particularly for autonomous driving AI. I would also not rule out Bloomberg as they have immense financial data sets and how companies interrelate. I suspect they are already using it and being private do not publicize it. MSFT except for OFFICE has been a follower or acquirer; they were way behind on AI and is the reason they partnered with OpenAI and did better PR.

Having worked in tech and invested for several years, I wanted to share how I’m thinking about AI and opportunity. I’m from Singapore, now living in Silicon Valley as a tech enthusiast. I’ve always hoped I’d be one of the builders of the AI age. But lately it feels harder and harder to see where real opportunities are. When people talk about industrial revolutions, it’s always about inventors like James Watt or machines like the spinning jenny. But you almost never hear about the weavers who lost their jobs, even though, for example, around two-thirds of them were displaced during the first revolution. To me, AI feels a bit like that. It’s reshaping entire industries at a pace that’s hard to keep up with, and in many cases it seems to replace more roles than it creates. In some fields, it even reduces the need for human coordination altogether.a fintech CEO mentioned at the All-In Summit(AI and tokenization could broaden access to investing and early-stage opportunities, not just for big players.) That got me wondering whether ordinary people today still have meaningful ways to take part in this wave of change, rather than just watch it unfold? I’ve been trying to balance between staying exposed to AI and not getting caught in the hype. Right now my portfolio is roughly 40% in broad index ETFs like VTI and QQQ, 25% in AI-related tech like NVDA, SMCI, and a bit of ARM, 20% in commodities and defensive sectors, and the rest in cash and some early-stage exposure through private investing platforms. Feels like the market’s already pricing in a lot of AI optimism. Curious how others here are handling it. Are you adding to your AI plays, staying diversified, or just waiting for a pullback before doing anything?

The result is that the average wealth of people in the economy typically grows faster than the debt. This makes sense because people and businesses use debt to buy and/or make things and then the resulting inflation eats away some of the real value of the debt. The problem is that the wealth created is not shared equally. Wealthier people tend to own more appreciating assets which benefit from the inflation and/or shares of businesses which can raise prices. Poorer people tend to have a greater share of their assets in cash which gets devalued by inflation. Also, printing money tends to be done instead of increased taxes which further benefits wealthy people who would otherwise be taxed. Lastly, the whole system crumbles if people start abandoning the country or currency enmasse. Greece had a huge problem of young people leaving the country for better paying European countries, leaving Greece with the older pensioners. And many countries that print too much money too quickly end up with worthless untrustworthy paper and their population starts using a different currency out of frustration.",laxnut90,13,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ohhkym/us_borrowing_to_soon_rival_that_of_italy_greece/nlof66a/,investing,,,

Let me know your feedback and how I can improve! This week of Oct 27 - Oct 31 is one of many catalysts, including the FOMC meeting, big tech earnings, and other macro events unfolding. One, there will be the FOMC meeting on Wednesday (Thursday Midnight if you're Malaysian), with expectations of a 25bps rate cut largely expected and price in. In addition, the key thing that will be in focus is whether the Fed would formally announce the end of QT (quantitative tightening) as JP Morgan outlined as their expectations last Friday. If true, this will be taken as extremely dovish since halting QT raises bank-reserve growth, which in turn lowers collateral risk and mitigates left-tail liquidity events. Note that the end of QT does not mean the start of QE (quantitative easing). However, it still supports credit and equities as it supports risk events and provides a significant stability backstop for risk assets like equities. To the speculators (or gamblers), many major tech companies are due to report earnings this week, see $META, $MSFT, $GOOG, on Wednesday after-hours, and $AMZN and $AAPL on Thursday after-hours, in total (+ other companies) this week accounts for around 20% of the S&P500 by market cap reporting earnings. A stacked earnings week like this often increases idiosyncratic risk and opens up strategies that are short correlation as the amplitude of stock-specific moves rises relative to the broader index. See dispersion trading where you could profit from the spread between individual stock IV (implied volatility) and the relatively lower implied vol. of the broader index. Macro-wise, trade negotiations between US (Trump) and China (Xi) are also due on Thursday, where apparently both countries ""reached a consensus"" through their correspondents (Bessent + Vice Premier of China) on key trade issues like export controls, tariff suspensions, etc... after ""constructive"" talks in Malaysia. A formal announcement is expected on Thursday. Was supposed to post this pre-market but got caught up with some commitments. Let me know what you think of this in the comments, would love to see potential avenues of improving my write-ups and my research.

Article: [https://www.phoronix.com/news/x86-Opcodes-Not-AMD-Or-Intel](https://www.phoronix.com/news/x86-Opcodes-Not-AMD-Or-Intel) A well known engineer posted on a Linux mailing list that there is a **new secret company** (not AMD or INTEL) going to produce chips. The company asked him to relay the message but didn’t reveal who they are. As I understand companies do this to avoid any collision once the chips go live. Intel used to sell x86 licenses in the 80s and then stopped. AMD still has one, and a few Chinese companies (like VIA/Zhaoxin/Hygon) have dormant ones. Looks like one of them might be waking up. I am not an expert in this field but it looks like there are quite a few Chinese companies still in possession of these licenses. Here are the ones I found so far: **Hygon / Haiguang (merged into Sugon’s server CPU line)** * Motivated to stay quiet internationally. * Actively building high-core-count, AI-capable x86 server CPUs for Chinese government / datacenter use. * Needs to carve out its own CPUID/MSR space and custom EVEX-encoded instructions. * Fits the AMD-lineage channel through Ludloff. **Zhaoxin (VIA + Shanghai)** * Legally x86, openly active in kernel/GCC. * Public ISA focus so far is AVX2-era, not (publicly) custom AI/tensor ops. * Historically not secretive. **Anyone else (VIA solo revival / Russian design / Western stealth startup)** * Very low probability given licensing, tooling, fab access, and zero supporting signals.",SomewhereSpirited834,0,9,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ohmwd9/new_mystery_chipmaker_who_is_this/,investing,,,

I've been thinking about this more since China's been tightening their environmental regulations, which is partly why their rare earth production costs have been rising. What really gets me is that we're essentially paying China to deal with the environmental mess while we get the clean end products. I've noticed this creates this weird economic dynamic where domestic rare earth projects struggle to compete not just on labor costs, but because they have to internalize all those environmental compliance costs that were previously externalized. I think this is actually one of the stronger arguments for strategic domestic production - not just supply chain security, but also taking responsibility for the full lifecycle of materials we depend on. When I look at my MP Materials position, I'm partly betting that investors will eventually price in this ""true cost"" premium for domestically processed rare earths. It makes me wonder if we'll see some kind of carbon border adjustment or environmental tariff system that levels the playing field. That could really change the economics of the whole sector.",trade_thriving,4,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ohurj3/among_the_17_rare_earths_these_four_will_matter/nlr866y/,investing,,,

I've been thinking about this a lot lately, and you're spot on - with oil, we at least had multiple suppliers and existing infrastructure elsewhere. With rare earth processing, I feel like we're looking at a genuine single point of failure that could take a decade or more to meaningfully diversify. I've been watching MP Materials try to build out their own processing capabilities, but even they're still years away from being able to handle their own output domestically. It really drives home your point about the infrastructure gap being the real bottleneck.

I'm curious which four rare earths the author thinks will be most critical in these talks - my guess would be neodymium and dysprosium for defense applications, but I'd love to hear other perspectives. The defense implications alone make me think this sector deserves more attention in a diversified portfolio than most people realize.",trade_thriving,26,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1ohurj3/among_the_17_rare_earths_these_four_will_matter/nlqthb1/,investing,,,

These 17 metallic elements enable critical technologies like EV motors, wind turbines, sensors, screens, and semiconductors. And **China dominates their production and refining**. While the U.S. once led rare earth mining, **China now controls roughly 70% of global output and over 90% of refining capacity**. Therefore, even when other nations mine their own deposits, the ores often end up being shipped to China for processing before reentering global supply chains. With **Trump and Xi expected to meet in South Korea later this week**, rare earths are back in focus. But not all rare earths are created equal. Some are far more strategic than others. First, here’s the full list (all seventeen), from most abundant to least: 1. Cerium (Ce) 2. Neodymium (Nd) 3. Lanthanum (La) 4. Yttrium (Y) 5. Scandium (Sc) 6. Praseodymium (Pr) 7. Samarium (Sm) 8. Gadolinium (Gd) 9. Dysprosium (Dy) 10. Erbium (Er) 11. Ytterbium (Yb) 12. Europium (Eu) 13. Holmium (Ho) 14. Terbium (Tb) 15. Lutetium (Lu) 16. Thulium (Tm) 17. Promethium (Pm) The most important are the ones known as “magnets,” and that’s where the real leverage lies. The elements to watch are **neodymium (Nd), praseodymium (Pr), dysprosium (Dy), and terbium (Tb)**. **Takeaway**: Trade agreements on the rest might move specific sectors, but those four are the ones that can move the market. So, regarding the current U.S.-China negotiations on rare earths, focus on news from those four.

XLK (S&P 500 Technology) and XLC (S&P 500 Communications) have better 3 year alpha and Sharpe ratios than all the other S&P 500 sectors even though tech and communications are supposed to be riskier. XLP (S&P 500 Consumer Staples/Defensive) has worse returns and risk adjusted returns than IUSB (total USD bond market) over the past 3 years. Healthcare is another sector that's supposed to be safer, but the performance has been abysmal this year because of UnitedHealth. You thought DIA would be safer because it's supposed to be more spread across sectors, but UnitedHealth has noticeably dragged it down. DIA's limited holdings make it somewhat riskier than other index funds since it depends more on individual stocks. the DJIA is also weighted by price, which is a pretty nonsensical way to weight an index in the first place. If BRK-A was in DIA, it would be 99% of the portfolio. Ultimately, choosing to overweight a ""safer"" sector doesn't necessarily mean the value of your investment is safer, especially when adjusted for inflation. This also applies to asset classes, but at least a rate cutting cycle is beneficial for bond prices.

What I find particularly compelling about this $1 billion deal is how it positions AMD beyond just the consumer GPU race with NVIDIA. I've been thinking that diversification into government contracts and scientific computing gives them a more stable revenue stream that's less susceptible to crypto volatility or gaming market fluctuations. The timing also feels strategic given the current geopolitical climate around semiconductors. I personally see this as AMD solidifying their role in critical US infrastructure, which could translate to more long-term government partnerships. The fact that they're building on their Frontier success suggests the DOE is confident in their execution capabilities.

Lots of talk of AI bubble, price of gold going up seems to signal a loss of confidence in the US as a safe place to invest etc. My current allocation is as follows: * FBGRX - 68.9% * FSKAX - 14.3% * SPAXX - 12.1% * FBTC - 1.9% * FXAIX - 1.8% * FSPTX 0.6% I've been riding FBGRX for a long time and I feel I'm way too heavy at this point. I'm considering selling a portion of FBGRX and moving it to international (perhaps FXPSX) and some gold (FSAGX). I've also been holding too much cash in money market (SPAXX) so I'll likely deploy this to one of the above. Also another consideration is I'll have to pay considerable capital gains on selling FBGRX because I've been holding for a long time now. For the move out of FBGRX I'm considering moving maybe 5% of my portfolio a month, instead of moving one lump sum at once. I'm 38 and don't plan on needing this money anytime in the next 20+ years. Is anyone else re-allocating given the current market conditions? Any thoughts are appreciated.

If you say something, you are called out and muted. On reddit you get banned. Also you have bot like behavior by opening new topics on different subs about rzlv.Profiles with low karma few posts, and new profiles. And then you have that one youtuber saying rzlv is going PARBOLIC....yet stock is going nowhere but down",Boring_Leadership_30,1,0,,,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1oi3q26/despite_rzlvs_attempts_at_correction_it_was_weak/nlsmuzv/,investing,,,

I would suggest that this is due to a huge loss of trust on the part of investors. I am still holding a strong short position. Yesterday showed that they simply do not have the strength or the ability to pump up the stock. Most traders expect a significant drop in the near future.
