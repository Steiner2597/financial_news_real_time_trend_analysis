If a company has 100 shares worth $10/each, the market cap is $1000. If I own 10 shares, my equity is $100 (10% of the company). The company decides to pay 10 shares to their employees as stock-based compensation. The value stays constant at $1000, but the share count has increased to 110. That means each share is now worth $9.09/share. The total value of my shares has decreased to $90.90 (9.09%). My share count did not change, but my ownership was diluted by almost 10%. SBC can be combined with share buybacks, so that existing owners are not diluted. If a company repurchases 10 shares and gives out 10 shares to employees, the net effect on existing owners is 0.

What country do you live in? * Are you employed/making income? How much? * What are your objectives with this money? (Buy a house? Retirement savings?) * What is your time horizon? Do you need this money next month? Next 20yrs? * What is your risk tolerance? (Do you mind risking it at blackjack or do you need to know its 100% safe?) * What are you current holdings? (Do you already have exposure to specific funds and sectors? Any other assets?) * Any big debts (include interest rate) or expenses? * And any other relevant financial information will be useful to give you a proper answer. .

It may play a role in the future, but it's an early stage company that is being treated by the market as if it's further along. Any blip and the downside could be considerable. Lets say a peer has an issue (and that Bloomberg article on Oklo a day or two ago was concerning), all the early stage/unprofitable SMR peers are going lower. That's not saying that the data center power theme isn't a thing - but it's been a thing for a couple of years now. A previously bankrupt company that did nothing much for several years after going public again (VST) is now up just shy of a thousand % in the last 5 years. That's not saying that it can't go higher in a best case scenario, but I don't see where the next thousand % comes from given the nature of the business and there reaches a point where something that's primarily done what it's done in the last 5 years because of the data center theme has considerable downside if there's even a *blip* in that theme (Deepseek headline in Jan and VST was down 28% in 3 days.) I've done very well with this theme for a couple of years now and was one of the few people talking on here about it early in 2024, but I've started to trim some of it. I will likely keep a good portion of it, but with reasonable expectations at this point of what further upside looks like in a *best case* scenario - not expecting the next 2-3 years to be a repeat of the last 2-3. Again, not saying it's bad - I still have a very good deal of exposure to data center infra/energy, so hopefully it does continue for a while (and in a market like this that doesn't care about valuation it may), but my only concern is that anyone piling in at this point as if it's inning one has to really hope that it continues at this pace.

The trick is whether that volatility pops like a bubble or drops like a crash. Chinas government will probably continue any manipulation to ensure the drop is soft, when it occurs, but that’s the game. Some combination of mature EU, LA growth, M7, Asian ETFs, and gold is probably as “safe” a medium growth package as you can develop because most of those aren’t too interdependent right now.

Agreed. It's also because capital flight got progressively easier. The norm level between countries changed because of the reduced threat of proletarian organization around an idea — and, countries also found themselves having to compete against each other to attract investment. The latter is a vicious spiral: countries with e.g. low corp. tax rates can't invest in their economies, which undermines the reasons why capital would flow to those economies in the first place; this leaves those countries with nothing to compete on to attract capital except for lowered corp. tax rates. Meanwhile, countries that already invest in their economies and see the benefit from doing so don't have to lower their tax rates to compete so much, because capital will readily fly to an economy in which investment has already occured. But those latter countries are fragile. One wrong step or exogenous shock and capital will fly. And then there's little for those countries to do but e.g. lower tax rates. If they invest instead as usual, capital investors will point out that such investment didn't preclude the wrong step or the shock. Reduced tax rates, however, are valuable to investors right here, right now.", "author": "highbrowalcoholic", "score": 4, "comments": 0, "sentiment": "", "tags": [], "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/finance/comments/1myyvev/the_twilight_of_the_central_banking_elite/naklqf1/", "subreddit": "finance", "symbol": "", "symbols": [], "user_followers": null}

How to Choose a Forex Broker in Malaysia Since not all online brokers are equal, the most important thing to be confident about before opening a forex account is that the broker is secure and offers the services you require. The bullet points below describe the more common considerations you’ll want to review before you select a broker as a trading partner. Regulation The primary consideration when choosing a broker should be the security of your funds deposited as margin. Select a well-regulated broker with at least one reputable regulatory body overseeing its operations and that segregates client accounts from its own. Most foreign brokers accepting clients from Malaysia will be overseen by one or more good regulatory agencies, such as the National Futures Association (NFA) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) in the United States or the U.K.’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Broker Type Online brokers will typically act either as market makers or as electronic communications network (ECN) brokers. Market makers take the other side of your trades, while ECN brokers pass on the best price of a selection of market makers who use its electronic communications network. ECN brokers typically show narrower variable spreads but may charge a per-trade commission, while market makers often have wider fixed spreads but no commission. Dealing Spreads and Commissions The difference between the bid price and the offer price in a broker’s quotation is known as the dealing or bid/offer spread. Since spreads and commissions add a cost to trading, active traders will want to keep them down as low as possible, while less active traders typically seem less sensitive to such considerations. Trading Platform Ideally, you want to find a broker that offers trading software with a customizable interface and that has the analysis features you require, as well as runs on the desktop, mobile or web platform you prefer. Virtually all of the best online forex brokers will support using the popular MetaTrader 4 and 5 trading platforms developed by MetaQuotes that offer a complete technical analysis functionality with numerous valuable trading tools, including a wide range of third-party expert advisors (EAs) and custom indicator software that you can use or purchase. Some brokers also offer access via cTrader, NinjaTrader, their own proprietary platforms and social copy trading platforms like ZuluTrade. Customer Service Most traders, especially those with less experience, know the importance of being able to communicate promptly with their broker’s customer support staff in case errors or issues arise. Traders new to the broker can also appreciate the material on how to use their trading platforms. Research, Analysis and Educational Materials These written and visual aids can be a major plus for traders with less experience. Even more advanced traders may appreciate having access to a high-quality news feed and market analysis performed by professionals. Understanding Trading Forex in Malaysia Forex trading in Malaysia allows traders to buy and sell foreign currencies in the Malaysian currency, the ringgit. Traders must first open a trading account with a broker to begin trading in the forex market. Once the account is opened, traders can buy and sell currencies, taking advantage of the differences in exchange rates. Forex brokers are establishing their presence in Malaysia as local demand has been increasing. The Malaysian ringgit, the local currency, was formerly pegged to the U.S. dollar. But in 2005, the Central Bank of Malaysia ended the peg. The currency is now a managed floating currency monitored against a currency basket to make sure the exchange rate remains close to fair value to help maintain the stability of the ringgit exchange rate. Malaysian residents can confidently trade forex knowing that brokers there are regulated by the Securities Commission Malaysia (SCM). Islam is Malaysia’s official religion, and forex brokers operating in the county offer products that comply with Sharia law. Regular forex account products charge or pay interest on funds deposited in the account, contrary to Islam’s tenets. Generally, trading practices that contain elements of interest or high-risk speculation are prohibited in Islam. As a result, brokers operating in Malaysia design trading account products that exclude loans, margin trading and short sales. Trade Forex in Malaysia Forex trading in Malaysia is slightly different from other countries because of the country’s unique regulations and restrictions. The Malaysian population is primarily Muslim, and the country’s official religion is Islam. Therefore, FX brokers operating in Malaysia have adapted their products to comply with Islamic sharia laws, which strictly forbid interest on deposits and risky speculations. The brokers listed here offer the best trading account options in Malaysia with products and features considered Halal (permissible). However, forex trading can be risky, and you should do thorough research before selecting the right forex broker in Malaysia.

Lowering the interest rates is not going to help lower mortgage rates as those depend on 10 yr treasury yield and those have not come down as other countries dont trust the US can pay down their debt without devaluing the dollar and massive inflation. So Lowering the interest rates is only going to help businesses and big corporations. And guess what, they will use this almost free money to invest in AI and layoff more of their workers!
