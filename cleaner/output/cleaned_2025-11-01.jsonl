{"text": "I updated my stock valuation sheet based on your feedback Hello again, last week i made a post about my stock valuation spreadsheet which uses wall street estimates and my (hopefully) conservative CAGR in order to calculate valuation estimates. The feedback from my last post was great and i did not expect that much interest. The sheet was shared over 700 times??? Anyways, thanks for the nice comments, questions and messages. So, for the updates i have made: - I added a gradient on the bar chart to more clearly show what is good/bad valuations. - I added historical FY revenues from 2022-2024 + Wall street estimates for 25 and 26. This makes it easier to see how the revenue scale into income. - Estimated revenue growth rate from 2024-2026. This is nice as the CAGR of the EPS can vary based on small number in divisor or one-off charges etc. Now, the biggest update is in my weighted PEG ratio which i use to sort the rows (the column furthest to the right). I added a 2030 PEG ratio column that i use to weigh the PEG towards future growth. I also readjusted the weights as follows: - 2025: 0.2 -> 0.1 - 2026: 0.3 ->0.4 - 2027: 0.5 -> 0.3 - 2030: (new) -> 0.2 I want to be cautious with weighing the model too much towards growth, as it creates more risk. The main goal is tho have a sheet that quickly sorts stocks based on recent price movements, to give a indication of what company to look into. My goal is to beat the SP500 and Nasdaq, so if you have any suggestions on stocks that can be added to the sheet, please leave a comment or send me a DM :) If you have tips on improvement to the sheet that is also more than welcome!

{"text": "Nvidia Forges Major South Korea Partnership, Supplying 260,000 AI Chips as CEO Huang Expresses Hope for China Market Access Nvidia announced landmark agreements with South Korea’s government and major corporations including Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor Group, and SK Group to supply over 260,000 advanced AI chips, marking what analysts called a watershed moment for the company’s global expansion. The deals include Samsung building an AI factory with 50,000 Nvidia GPUs to automate chip manufacturing, with Samsung also in talks to supply next-generation HBM4 memory chips to Nvidia. Hyundai will deploy Blackwell GPUs for AI-driven mobility solutions as part of a $3 billion AI cluster initiative. CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at the APEC CEO Summit in Seoul, expressed optimism over eventually selling Blackwell chips to China while acknowledging the decision rests with President Trump. Huang characterized China as an irreplaceable market representing a $50 billion opportunity this year and potentially hundreds of billions by decade’s end, though he noted the company is hoping for non-zero market share while expecting zero. He downplayed national security concerns, stating China produces plenty of AI chips domestically and has blocked Nvidia’s H20 chips, suggesting China doesn’t want U.S. chips for security reasons. The South Korea deal came as Nvidia crossed the $5 trillion market valuation threshold, becoming the first company to reach that milestone. Goldman Sachs raised its price target to $240, maintaining a buy rating and expecting another beat-and-raise quarter. Huang acknowledged the company faces challenges in high-bandwidth memory supply but expressed confidence both Korean suppliers will succeed with HBM4 production. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives characterized the South Korean partnerships as a watershed moment for Nvidia’s international AI infrastructure buildout.

{"text": "How the tokenization is related to pies? **“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”**: – Aristotle. When one is in their youth, the issue of searching for a companion is often at the top of one’s mind. The libido can take precedence over anything else, especially if there is a certain chemistry that clicks with another person. It is in this spirit that marriages can be the natural progression of this kind of relationship. In combination, both people find more happiness together than they would apart. Naturally, the next step would be to procreate and add a family member to this happy union. We can see that Aristotle did not necessarily refer to personal relationships when he issued his comment about the whole being greater than the parts. How does this apply to investing? First, companies often seek out other enterprises to become larger, more efficient, more profitable, or improved entities by virtue of adding product lines, intellectual capital, additional assets, or some combination thereof. Second, one tactic of investment is to identify companies where there is a large quantity of assets or operating businesses that the investment community is not recognizing for their total worth. The term given to this style is the sum of the parts investing. Now, let’s consider what is taking place in the world, which has many investors agog over the possibilities. It is the tokenization of every asset that can be sliced and diced. What exactly is tokenization? Tokenization is the process of converting the ownership rights of any asset into a digital token on a blockchain. The concept of “tokenization of everything” is accelerating as institutions and investors digitize a vast array of assets, from real estate to stocks. The underlying principle involves using smart contracts on a blockchain to create and manage these digital representations. Each token contains the rules and rights of ownership for the asset it represents. The range of assets that can be tokenized is comprehensive, encompassing financial assets, real estate, intangible assets (intellectual property- including patents, music royalties, carbon credits, and renewable energy), collectibles, and currencies. Proponents argue that the benefits of tokenization are improved liquidity with fractional ownership, which can be subdivided as small as one can imagine, and improved transparency with every record on the blockchain. All payments, like dividends, are automated for faster settlement and lower minimum investments, providing much wider access to previously restricted assets. The move to digitize everything allows banks, brokers, and custodians to offer every kind of transaction possibility in one place. You are seeing it happen at Fidelity, Schwab, Chase, BlackRock, Blackstone, and many others, giving access to digital assets like crypto-related tokens and stablecoins, along with stocks, bonds, cash, indexes, CDs, and in retirement accounts. From my perspective, a key issue is reducing costs and settlement times for those responsible for custody. From an investment point of view, just because an asset is tokenized and made more accessible does not make it more valuable. More people may be able to buy it at smaller dollar amounts, but the mere fact that it can be purchased more easily does not make the underlying economic value increase over time. In many cases, more assets are issued each year, which makes the threshold for acceptable levels of growth higher. If you split a pie into more pieces, it does not make the pie taste better or allow the owner to sell more pies. It makes it easier to buy one piece, but if the pie is not delicious and does not look good, people are not going to buy it. If we take this even further, access to IPO’s, private company assets like venture capital-based startup companies, private credit (loans and debt instruments), secondary debt underwritings, private equity portfolio companies which are not public, futures, forwards, swaps, options, commodity linked instruments, bank accounts, frequent flyer and customer rewards, and who knows what else, are all there for slicing and dicing into monetizable assets.

{"text": "Eastman Chemical Company, An Attractive Buy? If you have any questions feel free to message me or comment here. Thesis Eastman Chemical Company ($EMN) is mispriced by the market trading at 8.8x forward p/e, a valuation closer to cyclical peers such as AdvanSix ($ASIX), rather than specialty chemical companies such as DuPont ($DD) which trades at 17.74x forward p/e. This clear valuation gap suggest that investors still view Eastman close to its cyclical chemical producers, that is still exposed to swings in demand – Despite steady margins and a strategic pivot towards high margin specialty materials. I’m bullish on Eastman because the market is overlooking that their resilient margins, insider confidence and changing business mix, position it well for changes in investor sentiment. As investors start to recognise the companies more stable earnings and cash flow, amid its earnings on November the 3rd. 1. Margin resilience, Eastman has held steady its margins through a weak macro cycle (down only 0.9% YoY to 15.6%), showing a clear difference from its cyclical peer. 2. Structural shift, Eastman has reduced exposer to volatile segments. Such as, Chemical Intermediates (CI), which is now less than 25% of its product mix, historically 40%. Reflecting steady shift towards steady earnings and less cyclical changes. 3. Sentiment changes, recent insider buying, of over $1.9million, cost cutting initiatives and high capital expenditure focused on sustainable products create a realistic path for investors to view Eastman as more like a speciality chemicals company. Bringing them more in line with specialty multiples. A change in investor perception to coincide with fundamentals could see forward p/e around the 14x-15x ratio. This could lead to a 30% – 40% upside for the stock, from current levels. Plus, benefits of current high dividend yield of 5.3% make EMN an attractive buy. Company Overview Founded in 1920 and headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee USA, Eastman Chemical Company ($EMN), formerly a subsidiary of Kodak until 1994, is one of the world’s leading chemical product manufactures. It is globally diversified with 35 manufacturing facilities in 16 different counties and 60% of its total revenue being generated outside the US. Out of the over 1000 products they can be grouped into four different primary segments. 1. Advanced Materials – high performance polymers used in electronics, packaging and other applications. This is now Eastmans largest segments, with $777m in revenue last quarter. 2. Additives & Functional Products (AFP) – Performance additives for other chemicals. Used for coating, lubricants and plastics. 3. Fibers – Sustainable materials made from recycled waste and wood. Applications are in fashion, home textiles and linings. 4. Chemical Intermediates (CI) – Commodity and basic chemicals sold to other manufacturers and used in other products Eastman’s sell. Compared to peers like AdvanSix (ASIX) and DuPont (DD), Eastman benefits from greater product diversification and scale from its vertical integration. With 60% of its revenue being generated outside the US and 35 global manufacturing sites this mitigates any single market risks. Furthermore, Eastman’s size, from vertically integrated production, gives it cost advantages over its peers, as they are less reliant on external suppliers, helping them control input costs. This gives it considerable competitive advantages of its competitors in the chemical intermediates segment, where products are homogenous and competition is based upon primarily price factors. News / Catalysts Q3 earnings on November 3rd could act and a key catalyst to change investor sentiment. If again Eastman was to post about its steady margins amid global weakness, it would further differentiate it from its peers in the cyclical chemical manufacturers. Its earnings would be more akin to that of a speciality chemicals company; this could lead to a revaluation rating and triggering significant change to the upside in the share price. The CEO and Chairmen, Mark J Costa, along with ten other insiders, in late September bought up over $1.9 million worth of stock at an average price of $68.90, this gives me great confident this is a buy ahead of the recent upcoming earnings on the 3rd. Historically, insider buying at Eastmans has been a reliable signal for growth, in both 2009 and late 2015, similarly both times saw an over 15% gain in the following months. Together, insider buying suggests management’s belief that there is mispricing’s in Eastman’s earnings, reinforcing my thesis that sentiment could shift post Q3. Over the long term, European crackdown on unsustainable materials / regulations benefiting sustainable packaging create a great opportunity for Eastman to continue to capitalise from. As Eastman holds the technology required to create speciality recycled materials such as methanolysis compared to its peers like AdvanSix. Furthermore, sentiment shifts towards more sustainable packaging solutions create significant tailwinds for Eastmans sustainable high margin polymers in its ‘advanced materials and AFP segments, where demand is rising. Combined, these mid – long term factors such as, earnings stability, insider buying and sustainability tailwinds can lead to short term changes in investor sentiment and consequently significant upward movements in share price. Valuation / Data Eastman trades at a forward p/e of 8.8x and EV/EBITDA of 6.47x roughly half the multiples of specialty peer DuPont (DD), which trades at 17.74x and 12.52x respectively. Despite this discount, Eastman maintains not to dissimilar profitability, with 13.87% operating margins versus DuPont’s 16.6%, and much stronger shareholder returns, ROE: 14.52% compared to DuPont’s 0.31% This valuation gap suggests that the market still views Eastman like a cyclical commodity producing company. Similar to AdvanSix Inc (ASIX) which trades at an EV/EBITDA of 5.28 x and ROE of 9.85%. Rather than recognising its structural shift towards high margin specialty products. This misalignment with fundamentals shows clearly in the share price making them relatively cheap comparted to competitors. Investors are yet to price in Eastman’s transition towards less volatile less cyclical materials and its growing exposure to more stable products. If Eastman’s were to be re-rated closer to its speciality peers, this would see the share price increase by roughly 30% from current levels. Eastman’s valuation and perception as cyclical chemicals company largely stems from its historical exposure to cyclical markets such as commodities. Despite clear operational progression away from such markets their forward p/e is yet to reflect this change. Moreover, Eastman’s free cash flow in 2024 was up 26% YoY, and management expects further growth as it reduces capital expenditure from $700 million to $500 million by 2026, saying there “positioned to quickly resume investment when economic recovery occurs”. Moreover, achieved cost savings of around $75million in 2025 and targeted cost savings of $75-$100 million in 2026. These put Eastman is a considerable favourable position to improve shareholder returns with its sustain dividend of 5.6% and through share buybacks. Risks Key risks include continued weaknesses in global demand, particularly from automotive and construction markets, which could delay margin expansion. Additionally, while capital expenditure reductions improve free cash flow, underinvestment or mismanagement of funds may hinder sustainability projects and slow transition towards them. Tariffs and economic uncertainty may continue to delay product launches for Eastman’s consumers. Finally, if management fails to effectively communicate progress, investor sentiment may remain tied to its cyclical past, limiting any revaluations effecting share price. Conclusion Overall, I believe that Eastmans Chemical Co is a rating of ‘BUY’ as it offers investors a compelling value investment. Despite progression towards becoming a speciality chemicals company, the stock still trades at multiples akin to cyclical valuations. This creates a gap for long / mid term investors to take advantage of. With resilient margins, insider confidence, cost savings and, a 5.3% dividend yield; Eastman’s presents stability and upside potential. Thank you for reading my analysis.

{"text": "While KT screens as a value play, the lack of a moat kept me from investing KT looks cheap: 5x forward earnings, 4% dividend, EV/EBITDA 4x,but I’m passing. In a 3-player market that should mint steady returns, Korea’s telcos keep earning ROIC below WACC and spraying cash into side quests (AI, fintech, media, real estate). My base-case value is $19.3 per ADR (basically fair) so the risk/reward isn’t there. **What looked attractive** * Structure: Three national operators (SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus). High barriers to entry, spectrum moat, massive capex already sunk. * Price: KT trades at bargain multiples and pays a solid dividend. * Hidden assets: Meaningful real-estate portfolio and a cloud/data-center business; potential for “value-up” monetization. * Recent optics: Margins improved off 2024’s one-offs; buybacks and a more explicit shareholder-return posture. On paper this is the kind of steady compounder you want in the income sleeve. **Why I cooled off** 1) No durable edge. KT doesn’t beat peers on network, brand, or pricing power. In a rational oligopoly you’d expect fat margins; in Korea, the players still compete hard.

In a 3-player market that should mint steady returns, Korea’s telcos keep earning ROIC below WACC and spraying cash into side quests (AI, fintech, media, real estate). My base-case value is $19.3 per ADR (basically fair) so the risk/reward isn’t there.\n\n\n\n**What looked attractive**\n\n* Structure: Three national operators (SK Telecom, KT, LG Uplus). High barriers to entry, spectrum moat, massive capex already sunk.\n* Price: KT trades at bargain multiples and pays a solid dividend.\n* Hidden assets: Meaningful real-estate portfolio and a cloud/data-center business; potential for “value-up” monetization.\n* Recent optics: Margins improved off 2024’s one-offs; buybacks and a more explicit shareholder-return posture.\n\nOn paper this is the kind of steady compounder you want in the income sleeve.\n\n\n\n**Why I cooled off**\n\n1) No durable edge.  \nKT doesn’t beat peers on network, brand, or pricing power. In a rational oligopoly you’d expect fat margins; in Korea, the players still compete hard.

I have several individual stocks, held at the various transfer agents (ComputerShare, Broadridge, EQ) that were acquired as gifts over time when I was a child in the 90s/early 2000s. Gaining control of them all (getting dividend checks sent to my address rather than theirs, for example) has been a sllloooowww painful process, which I found out just today, I has STILL not been fully completed; as my mother just called to tell me she had a dividend check for me at her house. \\*sigh\\* I'm still trying to get a handle on everything, and get it all streamlined. My parents are old-school, and still drive their happy tushes to the bank to deposit those paper dividend checks LOL! I can't handle all that! I've sucessfully set up online accounts with computershare and broadridge. EQ says I've set up an account, but I beg to differ (but that's not the point, unless someone knows a trick to this issue). My real question is: there's a significant amount of asset \"moving\" I would like to accomplish, but I'm not sure how to go about all of it; and what's the best way is to accomplish my goals while minimizing fees.

Either way, wether through DRIP or splits, etc, the majority of my holdings are a combination of certificate shares and plan/book holdings.

Transferring to Interactive Brokers: I'm intending to utilize their SBLOC/ Margin Loan feature to help get my children and myself through a seemingly never-ending, financially draining custody/ child support battle; and since one of my children is very young I'm not working very much at the moment. I certainly don't need a massive capital gains hit, (not to mention the loss of the assets long term), while my normally taxed earned income is also lower than normal. I know they require portfolio diversity, and the maximum amount they'll loan is 1/2 of your portfolio. And I know there's going to be a transfer fee for each holding.

{"text": "Looking for China Stock/ETF Ideas: Focusing on 14th FYP 'Autonomy' Goals (IC/AI, Green Tech, Biotech) Hello everyone! I took a closer look at China's medium-term economic goals, especially the 14th Five-Year Plan. In doing so, I discovered three areas where the state is pouring in a lot of money and which are supposed to grow significantly by 2030. Now I am looking for tips for specific companies (stocks) or ETFs that could benefit most from these state strategies. My Top 3 Areas and Investment Ideas: 1. AI & Semiconductors: The government is pursuing an aggressive autonomy strategy. Huge sums are flowing into important areas of semiconductor production and AI infrastructure (especially domestic GPU hardware) so that the country can become more independent. Questions for the community: Which Chinese stocks (semiconductor equipment, materials, local GPU manufacturers) do you think benefit most from this state capital and the autonomy drive? Which companies besides SMIC are also important in building these supply chains domestically? Are there specific ETFs that better reflect this domestic focus than broad technology funds? 1. Green Energy & Clean Technologies: China is investing heavily in the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2060. The focus is on the digitalization of the power grids and energy storage, especially batteries (investments here increased by 69% in the first half of 2025). Questions for the community: Which stocks in the area of smart grids/VPP (Virtual Power Plants) or battery component manufacturing, besides the big players (like CATL), benefit most from the restructuring of the national energy system? Are there recommended Clean Tech China ETFs that place a strong emphasis on domestic storage and grid integration and not just on solar cell production? 1. Biotechnology & Bioeconomy: This sector is considered a strategic future industry, with a clear focus on biopharmaceuticals and national biosecurity. The government absolutely wants to bring biotech and IT together. Questions for the community: Which specific companies (biopharma, CDMOs or advanced seed technology) are considered leading innovators in China and benefit directly from this state funding for the bioeconomy? Important Risk Assessment My analysis shows that state-led industrialization carries risks that must be kept in mind: Overcapacity: High state funding can lead to overcapacity and strong price drops (similar to steel, solar, and electric cars in the past). Geopolitics: Technology (AI, biotech) and the strategy of military-civil fusion increase the risk of sanctions and export controls. Question on risk management: Which companies/ETFs do you think are best equipped against these risks (especially overcapacity and geopolitical pressure)?

In doing so, I discovered three areas where the state is pouring in a lot of money and which are supposed to grow significantly by 2030. Now I am looking for tips for specific companies (stocks) or ETFs that could benefit most from these state strategies.\n\nMy Top 3 Areas and Investment Ideas:\n\n1. AI & Semiconductors: The government is pursuing an aggressive autonomy strategy. Huge sums are flowing into important areas of semiconductor production and AI infrastructure (especially domestic GPU hardware) so that the country can become more independent.\n\nQuestions for the community: Which Chinese stocks (semiconductor equipment, materials, local GPU manufacturers) do you think benefit most from this state capital and the autonomy drive? Which companies besides SMIC are also important in building these supply chains domestically? Are there specific ETFs that better reflect this domestic focus than broad technology funds?\n\n1. Green Energy & Clean Technologies: China is investing heavily in the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2060. The focus is on the digitalization of the power grids and energy storage, especially batteries (investments here increased by 69% in the first half of 2025).\n\nQuestions for the community: Which stocks in the area of smart grids/VPP (Virtual Power Plants) or battery component manufacturing, besides the big players (like CATL), benefit most from the restructuring of the national energy system? Are there recommended Clean Tech China ETFs that place a strong emphasis on domestic storage and grid integration and not just on solar cell production?\n\n1. Biotechnology & Bioeconomy: This sector is considered a strategic future industry, with a clear focus on biopharmaceuticals and national biosecurity. The government absolutely wants to bring biotech and IT together.\n\nQuestions for the community: Which specific companies (biopharma, CDMOs or advanced seed technology) are considered leading innovators in China and benefit directly from this state funding for the bioeconomy?\n\nImportant Risk Assessment\n\nMy analysis shows that state-led industrialization carries risks that must be kept in mind:\n\nOvercapacity: High state funding can lead to overcapacity and strong price drops (similar to steel, solar, and electric cars in the past).\n\nGeopolitics: Technology (AI, biotech) and the strategy of military-civil fusion increase the risk of sanctions and export controls.\n\nQuestion on risk management: Which companies/ETFs do you think are best equipped against these risks (especially overcapacity and geopolitical pressure)?

I've been trying to wrap my head around the fundamentals of stock growth and the opportunities and dangers and I wonder if someone with knowledge can tell me if there's any merit to any of this: On a basic level, if more people are willing to buy than sell a stock, then the price will go up. But also, there must be a finite amount of liquidty with which to purchase stocks and once that liquidity is depleted through buying stock, then stock prices rises must slow down and level off.

However that also got me thinking, what if financial investment instiutions then just borrow more money with which to purchase stocks. They see the prices rising and say, \"We need more money to ride this gravy train!\" So they borrow more to purchase stocks and so demand continues to go up and stocks continue to rise.

So these fears feed in to the stock price causing it to drop further, which in turn then hits another tier of investors who also borrowed and now find their investment reaching negative equity so they too cash out and then we find ourselves in a sudden downard spiral in a race to get out fast.

{"text": "Netflix taps bank to explore bid for Warner Bros Discovery https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/30/netflix-taps-bank-to-explore-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery.html > Netflix is actively exploring a bid for Warner Bros Discovery’s studio and streaming business, retaining a financial advisor and gaining access to financial information, according to three sources familiar with the matter. The video streaming service has hired Moelis & Co, the investment bank that advised Skydance Media on its successful bid for Paramount Global, to evaluate a prospective offer, two of the sources said. Netflix also has been granted access to the data room, which contains the financial details needed to make a bid, according to two of the sources familiar with the matter. > Owning Warner Bros’ studio business would give Netflix control over some of Hollywood’s most successful stories and characters, including the Harry Potter and DC Comics franchises.

Reddit is currently heading into earnings with an average analyst price target of $226.96 (compared to the current share price of $201ish).\n\nSo with this in mind, I'm really bullish on RDDT earnings. Anyone else? I also plan on doing a small write up on the other earnings that are happening today and next week, so be sure to follow my account for those.

{"text": "GENDA (TSE:9166): Japanese arcade roll-up organically doubling sales in the US TL;DR Japanese roll-up GENDA (TSE: 9166) trades around 7.5× FY2026 EV/EBITDA despite consistently acquiring cash-generative assets at 3–6× EBITDA and achieving strong organic growth: especially in the U.S., where rebranded locations have more than doubled same-store sales. The company now prioritizes funding growth through operations, but M&A remains central to its model. With debt costs near 1%, GENDA’s structure is unusually efficient compared to Western peers. GENDA is a Japanese entertainment roll-up, consolidating a fragmented industry of arcades, karaoke venues, and prize game operators. Its business model is straightforward but powerful: acquire existing venues at low EBITDA multiples, rebrand and optimize operations, and monetize Japan’s strong entertainment IP (anime, gaming characters, and merchandise) through these physical spaces. CEOs of said businesses are often well over retirement age without a successor, whilst very large inheritance taxes loom when they don't sell their business before passing. GENDA has become the \"buyer of choice\" for many of these businesses. Since 2018, GENDA has completed more than 50 acquisitions, often at low-mid single digit EBITDA multiples, compared to its own public valuation range that historically peaked above 25× EV/EBITDA during periods of optimism. Even after a significant derating, the company currently trades around 7.5× next year’s EBITDA, leaving meaningful headroom for accretive M&A. The group’s core operations center on GiGO, the well-known Japanese arcade brand it acquired from Sega, alongside several karaoke chains and smaller amusement operators. In Japan, management sees steady but limited organic growth (ranging from 3-8%) yet the domestic market remains an excellent hunting ground for discounted acquisitions. Low rates, stable foot traffic (boosted by inbound tourism), and fragmented ownership make Japan a structurally favorable M&A environment. Internationally, GENDA is investing in expansion through NEN, Player One Entertainment, and a partnership with Walmart, giving it more than 13,000 mini-arcade sites in North America. These are compact, unmanned crane-game installations in malls and retail spaces, designed for high turnover and low operating costs. When GENDA replaced existing machines with its own Japanese hardware and prize concepts, sales more than doubled in all operating locations. This growth underscores the company’s thesis that Japanese-style physical entertainment, supported by strong intellectual property, can succeed abroad with proper localization. GENDA makes a distinct difference between domestic, where dirt-cheap acquisitions make up most of the growth, and international, where there's plenty of room both through M&A as well as organic investments. The broader strategic direction has evolved. Management has emphasized that the priority now is self-financed growth and debt discipline, aiming to avoid negative free cash flow after several years of expansion funded primarily through debt and equity issuance. However, this does not represent an abandonment of M&A. GENDA’s leadership has explicitly stated that inorganic growth will remain a core driver, and that higher EBITDA from each acquisition expands their debt capacity. This in turn effectively allows further M&A funded through balance sheet strength. This discipline coincides with a still-favorable financing environment. The company’s average borrowing cost remains near 1%, an enormous structural advantage over Western counterparts where debt funding for roll-ups often exceeds 6–8%. With that spread, even moderate-value acquisitions are likely to be accretive if integration remains efficient. Investor sentiment has been volatile. The stock fell sharply from its peak of ~¥1,600 to around ¥750, reflecting skepticism about sustainability, dilution from past equity raises, and concerns that organic growth may not offset reduced deal volume. Still, the balance sheet is manageable with net debt of roughly ¥67.5 billion against an enterprise value of about ¥208 billion. The key debate is about the durability of physical entertainment demand. Domestically, arcades and karaoke have proven resilient, with stable or even improving attendance due to tourism recovery and nostalgia-driven appeal. In the U.S., the early success of GENDA’s small-format model suggests there is growth potential if execution holds. But structural risks remain: shifts in consumer behavior, weaker same-store sales once novelty fades, or missteps in integration could all limit scalability. At roughly 7.5× forward EV/EBITDA and a market capitalization of ~¥135 billion, GENDA is not priced as a high-growth compounder. Yet its unique combination of low-cost financing, accretive acquisitions, and proven unit-level economics in both Japan and the U.S. gives it a differentiated profile among global entertainment operators. If management delivers consistent free cash flow while maintaining disciplined M&A, a re-rating toward historical multiples (even modestly, say 10–12×) could be justified. The case for GENDA, therefore, rests less on aggressive forecasts and more on execution consistency: can they integrate at scale, allocate capital prudently, and sustain the profitability of the physical platforms that underpin Japanese entertainment culture? I am very interested to see what others think. I have been looking at different (Japenese) small caps for a while now and am particularly excited about this stock. Whilst it might not be a typical value play being a roll-up/growth company, I'd argue the current valuation assuming little further growth already seems quite attractive.

{"text": "Why PayPal $PYPL Could Explode with ChatGPT Users We all know PayPal. It’s been around forever as the go to online checkout, though now there are other options like Apple Pay, Zelle and more. PayPal also owns Venmo. Growth hasn’t been huge. Year over year user growth is only around 1 percent, so it’s not exactly the hottest stock in the market. But, I think that will re-accelerate. But last week, PayPal announced a partnership with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. ChatGPT has a billion active users who will now be able to easily buy and sell through ChatGPT using PayPal. Even better, eligible transactions come with PayPal’s Purchase Protection and Seller Protection. This means users get the convenience of PayPal’s wallet in Instant Checkout, with multiple funding options like bank, balance, or card, plus tracking, dispute resolution, and all the protections PayPal buyers and sellers value. PayPal will also connect its global merchant network to OpenAI, creating a platform for tens of millions of small businesses as well as the largest brands in the world to sell within ChatGPT. I think this has the potential to add a ton of new active users for PayPal, growth that the market isn’t currently pricing in. Right now, PayPal trades at a PE of 13.25, which is really cheap. Forward PE is 11.9. They are also putting all of their free cash flow into buying back shares, rewarding shareholders consistently. On average, they increase the supply by just 10 percent per year, so shareholders see real value. The CEO is young and forward thinking.

{"text": "Is it time to switch from Market Cap to Equal Weight 500? My thoughts, really looking to hear yours. The S&P 500 just posted a new ATH 3 days ago, with nearly 400 of the companies closing in red. These news were disturbing to me. I have always been passive investor, trying to have the least possible number of sales and purchases as possible, to filter out noise, and follow my convictions. This, however, got me thinking. This is not normal, and can't be justified in the eyes of time. I know, I know - \"this time it's different\". Romans thought it too. It's not normal for a single company to have a valuation equal to nearly 1/6th of the GDP of USA. It is NOT normal. It's not sustainable. It does not create 1/6th of the value in the country. People don't eat it, drink it, or live in it. It's products are not 1/6th of your life or used 1/6th of your time. It's not normal for 10 companies to pull the entire index up, while the others are stagnating or declining. I have neither the personal analysis, nor the necessary skillset, or even just the sheer time to make a detailed analysis of the performance of each of the 500, but my conviction, based on my speculation and far-gaze is that the money are flowing in fomo to the hottest potato on the market, and, at least in my mind, there is a doubt, that the red is not based on (just, if any) the poor performance, management or sales of those 490 companies, but rather is capital being redirected to the forerunners, that have more and more ungodly expectations for performance bestowed upon them each new day, and these new and outlandish expectations are already priced in, and being upped with each new hype (Notice I didn't say pump. But really wanted to.) AI. The buzzword. The new hegemon. And don't get me wrong. I see it. I believe in it. I think, no, I am convinced we're on the verge of an Era. And AI is not the Era itself, it's just a corner stone, a building block of it. A big one, maybe the biggest, but not the entire thing. The humanity is on the doorstep of, most probably, the last epoch that we will see slavery again. And this time, we will convince ourselves, as spicies, that this slavery is different (mhm, again). It's not inhumane, because the slaves will be made of metal and circuits. Slaves that don't drink, sleep or eat, that don't have free will, and are, literally, created and programed for whatever we want. \"And it's not inhumane\" humanity will cheer. Anybody played Detroit:Become Human? That's what happens after. But while we get to the Detroit scenario, imagine the progress. Imagine being able to create a factory, that builds cars, or toys, or whatever your heart desires, filled with workers, that costed you a one time payment of a price, equal to around one-year salary for a human worker. And that factory works 24/7, with no recurring costs, other than maintenance and utilities. It's happening. Right now. But it's happening slow. Slower than we wish, slower than we hope, and more diversified, than we can imagine. Or at least than I can imagine. Maybe you're better than me. And it's not a single company, that will do it. Remember Cisco ($NASDAQ:CSCO)? They were gonna run the internet themselves. 25 years later, they're still below their ATH. It's the world, that's gonna do it. The companies that are producing the best examples are still not even public yet (Yes, I'm looking at you, Figure8). We have extreme expectations, priced in in a handful of companies. Behemots of industry, with uber-large staffing, rigid framework and heavy beaurocratic procedures, because this is what happens when you're a behemot of industry. It's how the world turns, ever since the Romans, because it's just how it works, if you want to command a large structure. And large and rigid structures are slow. Slow to innovate, slow to adapt, slow to move, because they are large. Swans and innovation come from small, nimble and adaptive organisms, because they can leap like no one else. And when someone strikes the gold vein, and skyrokets, they stop innovating, and start building rigidity, predictability and dependability. At least in my view, that is. What is my thesis? This concentartion is not sustainable. Those valuations are outlandish, and those promises and expecations are unkeepable. It's not normal, and it should bother you. It should bother all of us. Eggs in one basket, ever heard the telling? The world is more than AI or robotics, and that's coming from me, and I am heavily invested in tech. And sooner or later, the world is gonna have a sobering slap and remember it. I don't know when it's gonna be, but my speculation is that it will start with broken promises. Lack of adoption or enougu real world applications, that will make the doubts creep in under the itchy skin of Mr. Market. And then, oh my. Saying all of that, I am here to actually ask a question. These news were bothering to me, and got me thinking: Isn't it prudent to sell the winners and buy the underdogs when they're undervalued? Sounds 'bout right to me. I did a bit of research with Perplexity AI (hehe, the irony, eh?), and then double checked, and it turns out, historically Equal Weight 500 was beating Market Weight, by a good margin (+3-4% annually, IIRC). Last 10 years are a different story though. And now, we have the biggest, visible divergence of the two, widening the gap visually on the chart, from 2014 until now. I am quoting 2014 because this is the starting point of the ETF I am looking at: $XETR:XDEW . Currently, I hold my S&P position entirely in $XETR:SXR8 . https://preview.redd.it/qkcphsjdefyf1.png?width=3202&format=png&auto=webp&s=407ef7f7d68b9b5c9c72948d855f4e94fcfdf3dd I am thinking... Should I switch from $XETR:SXR8 to $XETR:XDEW and bet on mean reversion? Perplexity told me I'm right, but to be fair, would you believe a slave's praise to it's master? I wouldn't. Strategy is to track conecntration and breadth, and hold $XETR:XDEW while the capital within the 500 restructures, and then switch to market cap again, once the dust has settled, and the hangover from the sobering up has passed. I am really eager to hear opinions on this. I am not sure about it. I am sure about the part that's not normal, but I am not sure on what's the best strategy to deal with it, and as passively as possible. I am not convinced that I want to be the dumb roommate and miss the party too. So... That's my 5 cents :) Looking for yours", "title": "Is it time to switch from Market Cap to Equal Weight 500?

Currently, I hold my S&P position entirely in $XETR:SXR8 .\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qkcphsjdefyf1.png?width=3202&format=png&auto=webp&s=407ef7f7d68b9b5c9c72948d855f4e94fcfdf3dd\n\nI am thinking... Should I switch from $XETR:SXR8 to $XETR:XDEW and bet on mean reversion? Perplexity told me I'm right, but to be fair, would you believe a slave's praise to it's master? I wouldn't.\n\nStrategy is to track conecntration and breadth, and hold $XETR:XDEW while the capital within the 500 restructures, and then switch to market cap again, once the dust has settled, and the hangover from the sobering up has passed.\n\nI am really eager to hear opinions on this. I am not sure about it. I am sure about the part that's not normal, but I am not sure on what's the best strategy to deal with it, and as passively as possible.\n\nI am not convinced that I want to be the dumb roommate and miss the party too.\n\nSo... That's my 5 cents :)\n\nLooking for yours", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-01T23:28:25.982039"}

{"text": "These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days. This is why you can’t predict the markets. I made predictions for all the stocks in my portfolio. In just 10 days, a lot of them aged badly. To myself, and to you investors, don’t try to predict the market. My thesis: **Stock Positions 10/20/2025** **GOOG:** **Hold** after earnings when I will likely buy the stock **NEM:** While **tariffs devalue the U.S. dollar**, Gold is likely to **see record highs**. Interest rates are declining, which creates more inflation which will likely help NEM, which is a Gold miner, and gold miners are cyclical with the price of Gold. As worse data approaches the stock market (which is likely to come) Gold will keep making record highs. The USD devaluing + Interest rates likely being cut + an overvalued stock market + most other markets being overvalued is likely to allow NEM and Gold to continue to go up. Even though NEM has a large connection to Gold, NEM still must abide **by regulations** which could drag down the price, even if Gold is going up. Also, my MSR ratio shows NEM at 82/16 odds, which shows that NEM is highly overvalued on the (D) chart on TradingView. However, NEM has good leadership, and their **debt has reduced by 8.69B to 7.13B** (as of June 2025). Their debt-to-equity ratio is sound at 0.24. This is why I will **hold** NEM and wait for more earnings which are on Oct 23 2025 **NFLX:** Likely to continue with strong growth through Q3. Many analysts rate NFLX a buy before earnings and are increasing their price targets, especially after the release of some big hits (Squid Game 3, Kpop Demon Hunters). However, NFLX has fallen below its 50-day moving average of tomorrow’s earnings report. This should initiate caution to investors. Q3 has been a very good season for companies in the S&P 500. Out of the index, **12% of companies have had their earnings, with 86% surpassing expectations**. So far, this has been a fantastic quarter. NFLX is a big company and it’s likely to have a beat as well. Even though Q3 has been a good performance, **NFLX is exposed to the American consumer**, which if they feel the effects of inflation too harshly, might start to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. Also, Donald Trump, the president of the U.S said that he will **put 100% tariffs** on movies outside of the U.S, which would drastically affect NFLX’s profit margins, because **59% of all Netflix revenue comes from international markets.** Despite this, I believe that NFLX will continue to thrive and will likely beat earnings. This is why I will **buy** some NFLX before earnings tomorrow. **MU:** Earnings were fantastic. **Revenue surged up to 37.8B, nearly a 49% increase year-over-year.** Analyst targets range from $240 to $270, which is approximately a 20 – 30% upside. Although a fantastic earnings report, MU plans to **sever its chip business in China** after its ban in 2023 on its products in infrastructure. While it will still supply some things to China, this will likely, over **the long term hurt, revenue and revenue diversification**. MU has also been facing tariff headwinds **after the U.S added 10% universal tariffs** on all imports, which MU has suffered from. This is why I will **hold** until geopolitical tensions decrease. **If they increase, I will sell a chunk of my position**. I have already made 33% profit at the time of writing. **UNH:** One of the biggest healthcare / insurance service companies in the U.S, with exposure across insurance (UnitedHealthcare), health services, data and pharmacy benefits. This means it has multiple levers for revenue and margin improvement. It is an established network, relationships with other companies have been built over many decades (since 1977) **Investors like Warren Buffett and Michael Burry** have invested billions into UNH, seeing it as undervalued from recent highs. However, there is a reason for UNH being valued as ‘undervalued’. UNH have been facing rising medical costs, utilization and squeezed margins. The company has faced **a lot of uncertainty**, even at one point **suspending its 1-year outlook**. The company has faced **ongoing scrutiny into the investigation of Medicare billing practices and over adjustments**. This could bring **potential fines, reputational damages or operational constraints**. **The UNH CEO, who was shot in December 2024** caused turmoil in the company. Even though it’s been nine months since the shooting, it has scarred many investors, and customers about why the CEO was shot, and if UNH is doing bad practices at the company. For these reasons, I will likely **hold** the stock for the foreseeable future. **JNJ:** The stock has seen a good Q3 report, **sales up 6.8% year over year**. The growth came from its **“Innovative Medicine” and “MedTech”** segments, so its not overly reliant on one division. JNJ is also pushing new therapies into the markets, so its business is diverse. JNJ also revised down its **tariff expectations from $400M to $200M**, reflecting improved global trade conditions. The reason why I bought JNJ in the first place was because it was reliable and solid. It helped me hedge against market geopolitical volatility. Even though I like JNJ stock very much, key drugs **like Stelara (which is a big revenue driver) is losing its exclusivity or facing biosimilar competition** which could erode further revenue. After a strong run for JNJ, positive news might be priced in. Some valuation models say that **JNJ might be 4-5% overvalued** relative to its fundamentals. **In the worst-case scenario**, if a court hands down a massive talc verdict, or series of judgements JNJ could suffer an **earnings shock, cash flow and reputation**. This should keep investors cautioned of the future of JNJ. I will **hold** JNJ for these reasons until **further** **notice**. **BABA:** This stock has a lot of exposure to the AI market, **building the ‘compute’ layer**, which is for LLMs. It is e-commerce, but it could expand into technology through this. The stock has rallied in 2025, and some models **suggest that BABA is still undervalued**. BABA has **substantial cash reserves** for extra projects that could fuel revenue growth. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S and China has made created trouble for BABA. U.S scrutiny **because of U.S national security** concerns has impacted the valuation of the stock. While AI growth is exciting, Alibaba’s traditional services are under margin pressure. China is **dealing with a slowdown in economic growth, property stress and consumer spending being soft in many areas. Trade tensions may disrupt Alibaba**. Alibaba is also **viewed as a “comeback” and “transformation story”**, so there are high expectations, like any AI stock. Some analysts suggest most of the good news is already priced in. This is why I am going to **hold Alibaba until 11/21/2025**, when it has its earnings, and then I will do another analysis on the company then. **TSM:** This stock **manufactures** a large share of all **the most advanced chips in the world**, for big players **like NVDA and AMD**. Because it has such a large share, it has greater area **for growth and revenue expansion**. TSM has a moat in advanced technology which is extremely hard to replicate. **The accelerating demand for GPUs, AI accelerators, data centre chips, and related semiconductors benefits TSM**. TSM has had strong recent earnings. The leading edge that TSM has is **extraordinarily** **expensive to maintain**, for a company like TSM. If demand slows, then as the whole operation is so expensive, it could hurt TSM profitability. Geopolitical situation in Taiwan is delicate, because **if China declares war on Taiwan, the stock will likely drop a lot**. Cybersecurity and hacking is also meaningful in the semi conductor industry. Competition to remain the company with the most advanced chips is fierce, with Intel saying it will invest 33B euros and Samsung investing 11 – 16B dollars annually. I believe that TSM will continue to grow (no signs of growth slowing down) but if the AI bubble pops, and as China – US tensions grow (especially over Taiwan and tariffs) an invasion into Taiwan is not off the table. This is why I am cautious of TSMC’s future prospects. I am planning **to hold and buy small chunks** because of this earnings report and because of Post-Earnings-Announcement-Drift which will likely last a few more weeks. **MS:** The stock recently had a good Q3 performance, with their investment banking **revenue jumping 44% year over year. MS has also been given more flexibility to deploy capital, increase dividends or make investments, because the Federal Reserve has agreed to lower MS’ “stress capital buffer” from 5.1%, to 4.3% for the upcoming year.** Morgan Stanley is a big company, which has many diversified operations, like asset management, institutional securities, investment banking, trading and other operations which allows for multiple angles to expand revenue. However, much of their revenue comes from investment banking, so if just a handful of operations underperform, it could **affect MS and drag on profit margins**. MS is also exposed to the health **of credit markets** and the health of corporates, so if credit defaults rise, MS could face losses. Morgan Stanely would also be hurt, in the worst-case scenario, by a recession. In a recession, deal making, a large revenue driver would be hurt hart, causing a drag on MS. Given the moderate chance by most institutions of a recession coming in 2025/2026, trimming the position of MS might be a good idea. This is why I will **hold** until **recession fears are larger**. **JPM:** Similar to Morgan Stanley. I will **hold** until recession fears are larger. **UBER:** Uber has a **diversified business model**, (uber eats, normal driving, and AI services). This helps mitigate the risks associated with any single revenue stream. UBER faces regulatory scrutiny because of some drivers not being licensed. In Hong Kong, lawmakers have passed a bill to regulate this. **The FTC has taken action against UBER for deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its subscription, Uber One**. The legal challenge could result in fines and damage to Uber’s reputation. **Uber faces competition from Deliveroo and Just Eat, especially in the U.K.** This is why I will likely **hold, and if earnings are bad, sell some of my position.** **SPGI:** Standard and Poor’s. Had a good Q2 performance of 3.755B, a **6% increase year over year. The company also announced a 1.8B acquisition of With Intelligence, a private markets data provider. This will enhance SPGIs offerings, in the rapidly growing private financial market sector. Analysts maintain a “strong buy” rating for SPGI, with a 12-month price target averaging 609$ indicating a potential upside of \\~28%.** SPGI’s valuations are concerning. **The P/E ratio is at 36.3x,** which is above the industry average of 25.7x. DCF model suggest that a fair, closer value is 288$, indicating the stock may be overvalued. Like MS and JPM, market downturns could reduce demand for SPGI services and seeing as a recession has a moderate chance for 2025/2026, this is a possibility. Even though SPGI has concerning valuations, I think that I will allocate a large amount of money to SPGI before earnings. Right now, it is down -11% in my portfolio, but to me it, it suggests a buying opportunity, and as the stock has gone down a lot, the expectations for Q3 might be lower**. I will buy moderate chunks more SPGI**. Earnings on the 30^(th) of October 2025 **BKNG:** Earnings on the 28^(th) of October 2025. Booking Holdings has demonstrated **good financial results, with revenue growth being in the travel sector. BKNG is diversified, having many brands such as** [**Booking.com**](http://Booking.com)**, Agoda, KAYAK and OpenTable, providing a broad range of services. The company has operations in 220 countries, meaning that it has a strong global presence.** Booking Holdings is exposed to currency exchange rate volatility, which may impact revenue. BKNG is also very economically sensitive, so in a recession, it is likely to be impacted very hard. An economic downturn is likely not good for BKNG. **The industry is highly competitive, with players like Expedia, Airbnb and other regional platforms wanting market share. BKNG has a beta of 1.35, so it’s more volatile than other stocks.** For these reasons, I will buy **a small amount of BKNG before earnings.** **BRK.B:** 70% increase in profits in operating earnings, driven by a substantial rise in insurance. Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&P 500. I am not holding it to outperform the S&P 500, I am more holding it as a counterweight to more volatile stocks in my portfolio. Warren Buffet stepped down in 2025 which has been an issue for some investors, but I am confident in the leadership of Greg Abel. BRK.B is a very small position in my portfolio (because of Warren Buffet stepping down, and that turbulence) but the dust has likely settled, so I will **buy large chunks before earnings** (which is on the 3^(rd) of November, 2025). **DOW:** This stock has a strong history of dividends, which is why I bought it in the first place. It has a diverse revenue stream from multiple angles. The company is facing many lawsuits over misleading investors that it could withstand tariffs and sustain dividends. Analysts project that DOW **will have a loss of 0.31$** a share, a significant decline from the same quarter last year, that yielded positive profit per share. This is why I will likely **hold DOW through earnings, and see where things stand after earnings.** **OPEN:** Meme stock / speculative. **Hold / Sell before earnings report with the way things are going.** **AVGO: Strong Q3 performance, revenue of 15.95B, a 22% increase year over year. AI semiconductor revenue has surged to 63% year over year to 5.2B dollars, marking 10 consecutive quarters of growth.** AVGO has **a high P/E ratio of 89.3**, amidst this AI bubble, which is **worrying investors**. The company has also **had layoffs affecting sales, customer success, and account management roles, including VMware, which it acquired in late 2023. Even though AVGO had strong revenue, the stock still declined 4% following because it was not a good enough earnings report to please investors.** This is why I am **likely to hold till the next earnings report**. **NVDA:** Like AVGO, but they work in slightly different areas. **P/E ratio is 52, and the stock will be a hold until earnings.** **Sorry for the long essay!**", "title": "These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days.

In just 10 days, a lot of them aged badly. To myself, and to you investors, don’t try to predict the market. \n\nMy thesis: **Stock Positions 10/20/2025**\n\n \n\n**GOOG:** **Hold** after earnings when I will likely buy the stock\n\n**NEM:** While **tariffs devalue the U.S. dollar**, Gold is likely to **see record highs**. Interest rates are declining, which creates more inflation which will likely help NEM, which is a Gold miner, and gold miners are cyclical with the price of Gold. As worse data approaches the stock market (which is likely to come) Gold will keep making record highs.\n\nThe USD devaluing + Interest rates likely being cut + an overvalued stock market + most other markets being overvalued is likely to allow NEM and Gold to continue to go up.\n\nEven though NEM has a large connection to Gold, NEM still must abide **by regulations** which could drag down the price, even if Gold is going up. Also, my MSR ratio shows NEM at 82/16 odds, which shows that NEM is highly overvalued on the (D) chart on TradingView.\n\nHowever, NEM has good leadership, and their **debt has reduced by 8.69B to 7.13B** (as of June 2025). Their debt-to-equity ratio is sound at 0.24.\n\nThis is why I will **hold** NEM and wait for more earnings which are on Oct 23 2025\n\n**NFLX:** Likely to continue with strong growth through Q3. Many analysts rate NFLX a buy before earnings and are increasing their price targets, especially after the release of some big hits (Squid Game 3, Kpop Demon Hunters). \n\nHowever, NFLX has fallen below its 50-day moving average of tomorrow’s earnings report. This should initiate caution to investors.\n\nQ3 has been a very good season for companies in the S&P 500. Out of the index, **12% of companies have had their earnings, with 86% surpassing expectations**. So far, this has been a fantastic quarter. NFLX is a big company and it’s likely to have a beat as well.\n\nEven though Q3 has been a good performance, **NFLX is exposed to the American consumer**, which if they feel the effects of inflation too harshly, might start to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. Also, Donald Trump, the president of the U.S said that he will **put 100% tariffs** on movies outside of the U.S, which would drastically affect NFLX’s profit margins, because **59% of all Netflix revenue comes from international markets.**\n\nDespite this, I believe that NFLX will continue to thrive and will likely beat earnings.
