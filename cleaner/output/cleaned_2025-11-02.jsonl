I’ve been noticing a flood of new “AI-powered” investing and stock analysis apps lately, everything from portfolio trackers to bots that claim to predict trends and breakouts. With so many options popping up, I’m curious what’s actually working in 2025 for real investors, not just flashy marketing tools. I’ve tested a few like Danelfin and TrendSpider, which are solid for technical and automated analysis, but I’m looking for something that combines real financial data with smarter, institutional-level insights. For example, I came across Prospero AI, which takes a different approach by analyzing institutional trading behavior and converting it into ten clear signals (scaled 0–100) that show where the big money is moving. It’s been interesting because it helps me understand why certain setups matter, not just what’s moving on the charts. So I’m wondering, what AI investing tools or stock analysis apps are you actually using this year? Have any of them genuinely improved your results or made your workflow more efficient? Or are traditional screeners like Finviz and Yahoo Finance still your go-to?

{"id": "1oltpa0", "created_at": "2025-11-01T17:29:53Z", "text": "Why Vertical Aerospace (NYSE: EVTL) is Worth Possibly Over 13x its Current Price Once again, I boldly foretell a future possibility for the years ahead. Some reading this may scoff, or may laugh and move on. Those with an enquiring mind, open to rich possibilities for the future of humanity will spare me a few moments and read on. You may one day thank me for it. Before I proceed, let me paint a picture for you. Imagine a world where you can escape from the tedium of congested roads and polluted streets, while enjoying safe, rapid and efficient movement between locations. A world where you can rise above a city or landscape and gasp in awe at what you see. As I wrote in a previous article last year eVTOLs: The Fourth Rapid Mass Transport Revolution? that world rapidly approaches in my opinion. And after having eagerly followed the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) market progress for a number of years, and made outstanding returns on prior investments in Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation, as well as writing a well read Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on eVTOLs, that is why this week I invested in Vertical Aerospace (NYSE: EVTL). Vertical Aerospace is developing its VX4 eVTOL aircraft, as well as a hybrid eVTOL (HeVTOL) variant with additional combustion powertrain that offers additional range and payload for applications such as defence and logistics. With pre-orders for 1,500 VX4 eVTOL aircraft with a total pre-order value of $6 billion¹, including for leading companies such as American Airlines and Bristow, one of the world’s largest helicopter operators, it may not be long before Vertical’s aircraft are a familiar sight the world over. Of the many companies born of the excitement a few years ago for the nascent eVTOL industry, only four pure play listed companies remain in addition to a number of private companies. The listed companies are Archer Aviation, Eve Holding, Joby Aviation and Vertical Aerospace. Of all these companies Archer and Joby are the most well capitalised, a crucial aspect for any aspiring manufacturer given expert opinion that the cost of eVTOL development to certification is around $1 billion over ten years². Currently Joby Aviation is valued at $15.45 billion, Archer at $7.62 billion, Eve at $1.31 billion and Vertical at $444 million despite none of the companies having a government regulator certified aircraft yet, which is a requirement for commercial use. Let’s put that another way. Right now Vertical’s market capitalisation is trading at a 97% discount to Joby’s, a 94% discount to Archer’s and 66% discount to Eve’s. That is quite some discount! What is particularly interesting is that despite the wide range in valuations of the firms, the physics involved in eVTOLs leads to broadly similar designs, including the use of many common parts from well known aerospace and battery manufacturers such as Honeywell, Garmin, GKN, Leonardo and Molicel. That said Vertical’s CEO Stuart Simpson claims its VX4 aircraft has a larger airframe than its peer group as ‘we’ve basically got the biggest tube under the wings. They’re pretty tight. We are launching with four business class seats’³. I also prefer how Vertical’s VX4’s pilot is separated from the passengers unlike the Joby S4 design currently. Given what has happened in the past with aircraft hijackings this separation seems like it should be mandatory in my opinion. With safety in mind it is also extremely reassuring that Vertical are looking for their aircraft to be certified to the commercial airline safety standard of one failure in a billion hours of use. Vertical’s hybrid eVTOL announced this year⁴, and having been in development for approaching two years, further expands the business opportunity beyond consumer ‘Air Taxi’ services (a market forecast by Morgan Stanley as potentially worth $1 trillion by 2040⁵) into the defence and logistics markets. Its hybrid offering takes the anticipated range ‘from 100 miles to 1,000 miles and the payload from 600kg to 1,200 kg’⁶. It is worth noting that the VX4’s anticipated base payload of 600kg as far as I am aware is notably better than the 453kg payloads anticipated for the Joby S4 and Archer Midnight. Eve has not confirmed payload data as far as I know. The opportunity in defence is particularly significant in my opinion, thanks to the New World (dis)Order I wrote about in March this year. Largely thanks to the new US administration, NATO spending on defence is increasing and rapidly so over the coming years. With Vertical as the only listed sovereign British / European based pure play eVTOL manufacturer currently it may have a significant advantage over the others in my opinion should its VX4 aircraft be certified by Britain’s Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in 2028 as expected⁷. Incidentally CAA / EASA certification should be valid for commercial operations in the US and other worldwide markets I understand. So what’s holding EVTL’s share price back currently? Capital and capital with a capital C! They’re going to need to raise substantial additional capital to take them beyond about the middle of next year. It is worth noting at this point that Stuart Simpson, Vertical’s CEO, has stated that he is certain certification will occur in 2028 and ‘that is when we will be putting aircraft in the hands of customers’. He also stated he expects to achieve cash breakeven at the outset or 2030 at the latest⁷. Clearly that is conditional on raising further capital. My estimation based on all that I have read and heard, about Vertical and the eVTOL industry in general, is that somewhere between $300m and $400m additional capital will be required minimum. That is why I am considering a two stage approach to investing in Vertical Aerospace. This week I purchased 12,000 shares for my better half and I. That is stage one. As outlined in my Double Bubbler New Investment News email, to followers of my blog, before buying the shares this week, I hope to see the share price rise to over $7.00 by the end of the year following a successful first transition flight for the VX4 aircraft. Stage two. Will probably come after a capital raise by Vertical, a dilution as it is also known as. Yes I said the D word! Quite why so many investors fear dilution I do not know, as when carried out by a company for the purposes of raising capital to accelerate progress and commercialisation I am generally favourable. Just look how well capitalised Archer and Joby are now with share prices currently higher than at the point of dilution. Despite this, humans will be humans (no further comment!), so I expect the dilution announcement will cause the share price to fall, in fact I hope it does, as I will then consider increasing our shareholding depending upon how much capital will be raised and where it takes Vertical in terms of certification by 2028 and breakeven. To close this opinion piece… Vertical Aerospace is a company I will potentially hold for the years ahead given their apparent trajectory as well as potential for one day being valued at a significant multiple to its current value. 13x sounds incredulous, I know, but even that is currently far less than Archer Aviation and about $10 billion less than Joby Aviation!

Any insight is much appreciated. \"Wise\" is legally set up as a money transfer service, not a bank. Wise allows US Citizens to convert and hold foreign currencies. Wise has an opt-in feature to earn interest on GBP and EUR as a US citizen/resident. Likely due to complex US and international banking laws, a US customer earns interest in USD. Lets say I hold a balance of 100 GBP with Wise. Wise converts the 100 GBP to 130 USD and sweeps the money to their partner bank (JPMorgan Chase) in the USA. This money is covered by FDIC. The money earns interest on this USD. The interest is sent to Wise as USD and passed to me after they take a percentage as a fee. The interest is \"paid\" to me in USD but automatically converted back to GBP into my GBP balance. The interest is accrued daily and paid monthly. On any day at any time, I can convert my GBP to USD and send it to my US bank account. **My Wise account always shows a balance in GBP that does not fluctuate.** Wise is currently offering interest at 3.4% APY for USD, 2.42% APY for GBP, and 0.8% APY for EUR. This seems representative of the current prime rates of those currencies. https://wise.com/us/legal/us-interest-program-agreement \"*For EUR and GBP, their values will be converted to the USD equivalent before being swept and held in the same manner described above for USD. Conversions will be made once daily at the time the funds will be swept into the Deposit Account(s).*\" ---------------------------------------- Questions: Am I actually holding GBP or at least have the rights to GBP with this feature? How is Wise as a company protecting against currency fluctuations risk? Are they using currency futures contracts as a hedge, hence the fee they charge on those interest payments to me? Hypothetically, what happens if in one single day the USD devalues 1000x and now my 100 GBP is worth 130,000 USD? What happens to Wise, the partner bank, and my Wise account?

It is not only defined by the GDP growth during the time, but also the sectors that performs well during those times. |Cycle|GDP Growth|Sectors|Rates| |:-|:-|:-|:-| |Recession|\\-2% to 0%|Defensives|Lowest| |Early Recovery|0%-2%|Early Cyclicals|Low| |Mid-cycle|2%-4%|Technology/Resources|Rising| |Late Recovery|0.5%-2%|Technology/Industrials|Falling| |End of Cycle|0%-0.5%|Healthcare/Staples/Utilities|Falling| So if we operate according to the framework, let's check. * GDP Growth: 3.8% for Q2 2025, if we exclude datacenters and AI, it's at 0.1%. * Sectors: Tech stocks going new highs but so are the likes of Caterpilla and DOW Chemicals * Rates: More coming rate cuts expected The thesis that we are at the precipse of transitioning into End of Cycle is confirmed by the rates and the sector that's currently outperforming. GDP growth is a more intricate one since we are in a K-shaped society where while consumer discretionary is dropping among most incomes, the upper incomes and tech chads are propping up the economy for now. The likes of Costco, Walmart, Pepsi, Unitedhealth, Pfizer and many more have taken a beating in recent months, but have started to recover to prior to April 2025.

The feedback from my last post was great and i did not expect that much interest. The sheet was shared over 700 times??? Anyways, thanks for the nice comments, questions and messages. So, for the updates i have made: - I added a gradient on the bar chart to more clearly show what is good/bad valuations. - I added historical FY revenues from 2022-2024 + Wall street estimates for 25 and 26. This makes it easier to see how the revenue scale into income. - Estimated revenue growth rate from 2024-2026. This is nice as the CAGR of the EPS can vary based on small number in divisor or one-off charges etc. Now, the biggest update is in my weighted PEG ratio which i use to sort the rows (the column furthest to the right). I added a 2030 PEG ratio column that i use to weigh the PEG towards future growth. I also readjusted the weights as follows: - 2025: 0.2 -> 0.1 - 2026: 0.3 ->0.4 - 2027: 0.5 -> 0.3 - 2030: (new) -> 0.2 I want to be cautious with weighing the model too much towards growth, as it creates more risk. The main goal is tho have a sheet that quickly sorts stocks based on recent price movements, to give a indication of what company to look into. My goal is to beat the SP500 and Nasdaq, so if you have any suggestions on stocks that can be added to the sheet, please leave a comment or send me a DM :) If you have tips on improvement to the sheet that is also more than welcome!

I'm looking for feedback on a 4-fund strategy I've put together, with an eye on the current macroeconomic conditions (inflation, interest rates, potential recession, etc.). My Goal & Horizon: A 70/30 stocks and bonds portfolio. My primary goal is heavy growth exposure now, with a conservative sleeve to capitalize on future dips.

I want to maintain a level of liquidity/optionality to potentially take profits or deploy capital into other opportunities (like a down payment on another investment property) in the coming years.

TIPS Allocation: Is 10% in TIPS sufficient for inflation protection, or would you recommend shifting some of the BIV allocation to TIPS, or even removing TIPS?

The deals include Samsung building an AI factory with 50,000 Nvidia GPUs to automate chip manufacturing, with Samsung also in talks to supply next-generation HBM4 memory chips to Nvidia. Hyundai will deploy Blackwell GPUs for AI-driven mobility solutions as part of a $3 billion AI cluster initiative. CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at the APEC CEO Summit in Seoul, expressed optimism over eventually selling Blackwell chips to China while acknowledging the decision rests with President Trump. Huang characterized China as an irreplaceable market representing a $50 billion opportunity this year and potentially hundreds of billions by decade’s end, though he noted the company is hoping for non-zero market share while expecting zero. He downplayed national security concerns, stating China produces plenty of AI chips domestically and has blocked Nvidia’s H20 chips, suggesting China doesn’t want U.S. chips for security reasons. The South Korea deal came as Nvidia crossed the $5 trillion market valuation threshold, becoming the first company to reach that milestone. Goldman Sachs raised its price target to $240, maintaining a buy rating and expecting another beat-and-raise quarter. Huang acknowledged the company faces challenges in high-bandwidth memory supply but expressed confidence both Korean suppliers will succeed with HBM4 production. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives characterized the South Korean partnerships as a watershed moment for Nvidia’s international AI infrastructure buildout. The agreements demonstrate Nvidia’s strategy to expand aggressively in markets where it can operate freely while navigating ongoing U.S. China trade tensions that have restricted its access to the Chinese market. **Timeline of Events** * 11:35 AM Reuters Nvidia to supply over 260,000 Blackwell AI chips to South Korea, marking one of the largest national AI infrastructure partnerships to date. * 11:40 AM Reuters / Yahoo Finance / WSJ Samsung reveals talks to provide next-generation HBM4 memory chips to Nvidia, supporting the new AI cluster projects.

{"id": "1olc4gl", "created_at": "2025-11-01T01:44:00Z", "text": "How the tokenization is related to pies? **“The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.”**: – Aristotle. When one is in their youth, the issue of searching for a companion is often at the top of one’s mind. The libido can take precedence over anything else, especially if there is a certain chemistry that clicks with another person. It is in this spirit that marriages can be the natural progression of this kind of relationship. In combination, both people find more happiness together than they would apart. Naturally, the next step would be to procreate and add a family member to this happy union. We can see that Aristotle did not necessarily refer to personal relationships when he issued his comment about the whole being greater than the parts. How does this apply to investing? First, companies often seek out other enterprises to become larger, more efficient, more profitable, or improved entities by virtue of adding product lines, intellectual capital, additional assets, or some combination thereof. Second, one tactic of investment is to identify companies where there is a large quantity of assets or operating businesses that the investment community is not recognizing for their total worth. The term given to this style is the sum of the parts investing. Now, let’s consider what is taking place in the world, which has many investors agog over the possibilities. It is the tokenization of every asset that can be sliced and diced. What exactly is tokenization? Tokenization is the process of converting the ownership rights of any asset into a digital token on a blockchain. The concept of “tokenization of everything” is accelerating as institutions and investors digitize a vast array of assets, from real estate to stocks. The underlying principle involves using smart contracts on a blockchain to create and manage these digital representations. Each token contains the rules and rights of ownership for the asset it represents. The range of assets that can be tokenized is comprehensive, encompassing financial assets, real estate, intangible assets (intellectual property- including patents, music royalties, carbon credits, and renewable energy), collectibles, and currencies. Proponents argue that the benefits of tokenization are improved liquidity with fractional ownership, which can be subdivided as small as one can imagine, and improved transparency with every record on the blockchain. All payments, like dividends, are automated for faster settlement and lower minimum investments, providing much wider access to previously restricted assets. The move to digitize everything allows banks, brokers, and custodians to offer every kind of transaction possibility in one place. You are seeing it happen at Fidelity, Schwab, Chase, BlackRock, Blackstone, and many others, giving access to digital assets like crypto-related tokens and stablecoins, along with stocks, bonds, cash, indexes, CDs, and in retirement accounts. From my perspective, a key issue is reducing costs and settlement times for those responsible for custody. From an investment point of view, just because an asset is tokenized and made more accessible does not make it more valuable. More people may be able to buy it at smaller dollar amounts, but the mere fact that it can be purchased more easily does not make the underlying economic value increase over time. In many cases, more assets are issued each year, which makes the threshold for acceptable levels of growth higher. If you split a pie into more pieces, it does not make the pie taste better or allow the owner to sell more pies. It makes it easier to buy one piece, but if the pie is not delicious and does not look good, people are not going to buy it.

{"id": "1olb4vk", "created_at": "2025-11-01T00:52:47Z", "text": "Eastman Chemical Company, An Attractive Buy? If you have any questions feel free to message me or comment here. Thesis Eastman Chemical Company ($EMN) is mispriced by the market trading at 8.8x forward p/e, a valuation closer to cyclical peers such as AdvanSix ($ASIX), rather than specialty chemical companies such as DuPont ($DD) which trades at 17.74x forward p/e. This clear valuation gap suggest that investors still view Eastman close to its cyclical chemical producers, that is still exposed to swings in demand – Despite steady margins and a strategic pivot towards high margin specialty materials. I’m bullish on Eastman because the market is overlooking that their resilient margins, insider confidence and changing business mix, position it well for changes in investor sentiment. As investors start to recognise the companies more stable earnings and cash flow, amid its earnings on November the 3rd. 1. Margin resilience, Eastman has held steady its margins through a weak macro cycle (down only 0.9% YoY to 15.6%), showing a clear difference from its cyclical peer. 2. Structural shift, Eastman has reduced exposer to volatile segments. Such as, Chemical Intermediates (CI), which is now less than 25% of its product mix, historically 40%. Reflecting steady shift towards steady earnings and less cyclical changes. 3. Sentiment changes, recent insider buying, of over $1.9million, cost cutting initiatives and high capital expenditure focused on sustainable products create a realistic path for investors to view Eastman as more like a speciality chemicals company. Bringing them more in line with specialty multiples. A change in investor perception to coincide with fundamentals could see forward p/e around the 14x-15x ratio. This could lead to a 30% – 40% upside for the stock, from current levels. Plus, benefits of current high dividend yield of 5.3% make EMN an attractive buy. Company Overview Founded in 1920 and headquartered in Kingsport, Tennessee USA, Eastman Chemical Company ($EMN), formerly a subsidiary of Kodak until 1994, is one of the world’s leading chemical product manufactures. It is globally diversified with 35 manufacturing facilities in 16 different counties and 60% of its total revenue being generated outside the US. Out of the over 1000 products they can be grouped into four different primary segments. 1. Advanced Materials – high performance polymers used in electronics, packaging and other applications. This is now Eastmans largest segments, with $777m in revenue last quarter. 2. Additives & Functional Products (AFP) – Performance additives for other chemicals. Used for coating, lubricants and plastics. 3. Fibers – Sustainable materials made from recycled waste and wood. Applications are in fashion, home textiles and linings. 4. Chemical Intermediates (CI) – Commodity and basic chemicals sold to other manufacturers and used in other products Eastman’s sell. Compared to peers like AdvanSix (ASIX) and DuPont (DD), Eastman benefits from greater product diversification and scale from its vertical integration. With 60% of its revenue being generated outside the US and 35 global manufacturing sites this mitigates any single market risks. Furthermore, Eastman’s size, from vertically integrated production, gives it cost advantages over its peers, as they are less reliant on external suppliers, helping them control input costs. This gives it considerable competitive advantages of its competitors in the chemical intermediates segment, where products are homogenous and competition is based upon primarily price factors. News / Catalysts Q3 earnings on November 3rd could act and a key catalyst to change investor sentiment. If again Eastman was to post about its steady margins amid global weakness, it would further differentiate it from its peers in the cyclical chemical manufacturers. Its earnings would be more akin to that of a speciality chemicals company; this could lead to a revaluation rating and triggering significant change to the upside in the share price. The CEO and Chairmen, Mark J Costa, along with ten other insiders, in late September bought up over $1.9 million worth of stock at an average price of $68.90, this gives me great confident this is a buy ahead of the recent upcoming earnings on the 3rd. Historically, insider buying at Eastmans has been a reliable signal for growth, in both 2009 and late 2015, similarly both times saw an over 15% gain in the following months. Together, insider buying suggests management’s belief that there is mispricing’s in Eastman’s earnings, reinforcing my thesis that sentiment could shift post Q3. Over the long term, European crackdown on unsustainable materials / regulations benefiting sustainable packaging create a great opportunity for Eastman to continue to capitalise from. As Eastman holds the technology required to create speciality recycled materials such as methanolysis compared to its peers like AdvanSix. Furthermore, sentiment shifts towards more sustainable packaging solutions create significant tailwinds for Eastmans sustainable high margin polymers in its ‘advanced materials and AFP segments, where demand is rising. Combined, these mid – long term factors such as, earnings stability, insider buying and sustainability tailwinds can lead to short term changes in investor sentiment and consequently significant upward movements in share price. Valuation / Data Eastman trades at a forward p/e of 8.8x and EV/EBITDA of 6.47x roughly half the multiples of specialty peer DuPont (DD), which trades at 17.74x and 12.52x respectively. Despite this discount, Eastman maintains not to dissimilar profitability, with 13.87% operating margins versus DuPont’s 16.6%, and much stronger shareholder returns, ROE: 14.52% compared to DuPont’s 0.31% This valuation gap suggests that the market still views Eastman like a cyclical commodity producing company. Similar to AdvanSix Inc (ASIX) which trades at an EV/EBITDA of 5.28 x and ROE of 9.85%. Rather than recognising its structural shift towards high margin specialty products. This misalignment with fundamentals shows clearly in the share price making them relatively cheap comparted to competitors. Investors are yet to price in Eastman’s transition towards less volatile less cyclical materials and its growing exposure to more stable products. If Eastman’s were to be re-rated closer to its speciality peers, this would see the share price increase by roughly 30% from current levels. Eastman’s valuation and perception as cyclical chemicals company largely stems from its historical exposure to cyclical markets such as commodities. Despite clear operational progression away from such markets their forward p/e is yet to reflect this change. Moreover, Eastman’s free cash flow in 2024 was up 26% YoY, and management expects further growth as it reduces capital expenditure from $700 million to $500 million by 2026, saying there “positioned to quickly resume investment when economic recovery occurs”. Moreover, achieved cost savings of around $75million in 2025 and targeted cost savings of $75-$100 million in 2026. These put Eastman is a considerable favourable position to improve shareholder returns with its sustain dividend of 5.6% and through share buybacks. Risks Key risks include continued weaknesses in global demand, particularly from automotive and construction markets, which could delay margin expansion. Additionally, while capital expenditure reductions improve free cash flow, underinvestment or mismanagement of funds may hinder sustainability projects and slow transition towards them. Tariffs and economic uncertainty may continue to delay product launches for Eastman’s consumers. Finally, if management fails to effectively communicate progress, investor sentiment may remain tied to its cyclical past, limiting any revaluations effecting share price. Conclusion Overall, I believe that Eastmans Chemical Co is a rating of ‘BUY’ as it offers investors a compelling value investment. Despite progression towards becoming a speciality chemicals company, the stock still trades at multiples akin to cyclical valuations. This creates a gap for long / mid term investors to take advantage of. With resilient margins, insider confidence, cost savings and, a 5.3% dividend yield; Eastman’s presents stability and upside potential. Thank you for reading my analysis.

Hi, This is just a basic investing question , I’m still learning, so please go easy on me. I know it’s impossible to time the market, and the best long term strategy is usually to buy index funds and hold them. But from an investing point of view, I was wondering: If I expect a recession in the next six months and my portfolio is 100% in stocks (half in index funds and half in individual stocks), would it make sense to sell my individual stocks and move that money into bonds and index (50 50)? That way, if a recession happens, I’d have safer investments and some liquidity from bonds to buy undervalued stocks later. I know I could also buy gold or use puts, but that feels too risky with the options. Like my protfolio would look like 70% index fund and 30% bond What are your thoughts on that approach?

We don't know if GOOGL or PLTR or any of the other like NVDA will tank by 50% one not-so fine day. There's a stylized fact that the stock fall returns are significantly higher than stock spike returns. Idea behind my risk management technique is that stocks keep rallying because of money printing or whatever else, until a serious concern arises, which is when they tank by a big percentage, that too within a week. This a tail risk. Usually, downside tail risk is lot higher than upside tail risk. I will take PLTR as an example. Highly overvalued and if the acceleration of growth is not sustained, the stock will tank. Suppose I have 1000 stocks. I will keep selling 10 lots of covered calls which are deep out of the money. These are weekly options I am talking about. In this case, I'd sell say $240 call options (covered calls). Usually, it just happens that the same moneyness put option would also be priced around the same value. So assuming PLTR is at $200, the puts at $160 strike (same expiry namely weekly) will usually cost the same even though this is not etched in stone. So selling calls gets me some money, and I can buy puts with that money. All in all, I did not lose anything. For some reason, if PLTR spikes to $300 in one week, I'd be screwed. This has certainly happened and the main hypothesis behind this strategy is that PLTR stock price would not spike that way in one week. However, stocks are known to tank to like 50% or lower in one day ... let alone a week. Now when it comes to earnings, I buy a put, but won't sell a covered call. So if the earnings result in a big spike in stock price, I don't want to cap it using the covered call. But outside of this known event, selling covered calls, and buying puts using that money, seems to be a good way to kinda \"protect your investment\" right? Once again, this risk management \"strategy\" will fail miserably if the stock spikes by 50% or more in one week. Maybe that's has happened in the past, but that's the call people have to make. Can that happen to this particular stock? If not, I will take a bet and use this strategy to mitigate the downside risk.

I took a closer look at China's medium-term economic goals, especially the 14th Five-Year Plan. In doing so, I discovered three areas where the state is pouring in a lot of money and which are supposed to grow significantly by 2030. Now I am looking for tips for specific companies (stocks) or ETFs that could benefit most from these state strategies. My Top 3 Areas and Investment Ideas: 1. AI & Semiconductors: The government is pursuing an aggressive autonomy strategy. Huge sums are flowing into important areas of semiconductor production and AI infrastructure (especially domestic GPU hardware) so that the country can become more independent. Questions for the community: Which Chinese stocks (semiconductor equipment, materials, local GPU manufacturers) do you think benefit most from this state capital and the autonomy drive? Which companies besides SMIC are also important in building these supply chains domestically? Are there specific ETFs that better reflect this domestic focus than broad technology funds? 1. Green Energy & Clean Technologies: China is investing heavily in the goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2060. The focus is on the digitalization of the power grids and energy storage, especially batteries (investments here increased by 69% in the first half of 2025). Questions for the community: Which stocks in the area of smart grids/VPP (Virtual Power Plants) or battery component manufacturing, besides the big players (like CATL), benefit most from the restructuring of the national energy system? Are there recommended Clean Tech China ETFs that place a strong emphasis on domestic storage and grid integration and not just on solar cell production? 1. Biotechnology & Bioeconomy: This sector is considered a strategic future industry, with a clear focus on biopharmaceuticals and national biosecurity. The government absolutely wants to bring biotech and IT together. Questions for the community: Which specific companies (biopharma, CDMOs or advanced seed technology) are considered leading innovators in China and benefit directly from this state funding for the bioeconomy? Important Risk Assessment My analysis shows that state-led industrialization carries risks that must be kept in mind: Overcapacity: High state funding can lead to overcapacity and strong price drops (similar to steel, solar, and electric cars in the past). Geopolitics: Technology (AI, biotech) and the strategy of military-civil fusion increase the risk of sanctions and export controls. Question on risk management: Which companies/ETFs do you think are best equipped against these risks (especially overcapacity and geopolitical pressure)? How do you take these factors into account when determining your position sizes?

The core conviction is that market efficiency problems are creating non-directional alpha. 1) The Liquidity Dominance: Research confirms that liquidity risk dominates credit risk in explaining variations in yield spreads for emerging corporate and sovereign debt. Liquidity alone explains as much as 25% of the cross-sectional variation in corporate bond yield spreads. 2) The Duration Sweet Spot: The 2 to 5 year corporate bond segment is emerging as the optimal duration strategy, offering an ideal combination of attractive yields, limited interest rate sensitivity, and superior liquidity characteristics in the current environment. 3) The Crowding Risk: Corporate bond issuance has shifted from loans, reaching ₹51.58 trillion (18% of GDP) in the Indian market alone.

Everything I read, including my own sentiment, suggests the market is currently highly overvalued. PEs are very high compared to historical averages and buying at these valuations makes many nervous. I know many hate PEs because they don’t tell the full story, which is true, but they can be one of many tools to assess the market. Having said that, I’m always trying to play devils advocate, even with my own thesis. I’m trying to come up with scenarios that could normalize valuations without a crash, even ones that may seem improbable. I feel like it would be tough to generate enough revenue from AI to grow into their valuations. But what does seem feasible is the possibility of MAG7 cutting AI spending at some point. I know that seems highly improbable at the moment, but I feel like the unexpected is often what happens. If MAG7 cut AI spending (or reached economies of scale to reduce spending), it seems highly likely that their existing revenue streams, which are very strong, would remain intact. If that happened, their earnings would increase dramatically (via cost reduction but stable revenue) and their respective PEs would also trend towards normalization.

I've been trying to wrap my head around the fundamentals of stock growth and the opportunities and dangers and I wonder if someone with knowledge can tell me if there's any merit to any of this: On a basic level, if more people are willing to buy than sell a stock, then the price will go up. But also, there must be a finite amount of liquidty with which to purchase stocks and once that liquidity is depleted through buying stock, then stock prices rises must slow down and level off. Take the term \"depleted\" broadly just for the sake of this exercise. However that also got me thinking, what if financial investment instiutions then just borrow more money with which to purchase stocks. They see the prices rising and say, \"We need more money to ride this gravy train!\" So they borrow more to purchase stocks and so demand continues to go up and stocks continue to rise. But if this is the case, isn't there an inherent danger in that if at any point there's a price dip that starts to spook those investors that borrowed, then they'll want to get out fast so they can keep their gains and pay off the borrowed debt? The last thing they want is to owe someone money and find themselves paying interest and unable to pay it off without realising a loss. So these fears feed in to the stock price causing it to drop further, which in turn then hits another tier of investors who also borrowed and now find their investment reaching negative equity so they too cash out and then we find ourselves in a sudden downard spiral in a race to get out fast. Is any of this a thing? Do large investment institutions borrow to make these kind of investments or do they only buy with what they have on the books from their clients? Because I feel like either the stock market must stop climbing at some point due to liquidty running out OR if there's a lot of borrowing going on then at some point that's got to cause a crash the moment the market gets spooked and now everyone is racing to pay off their debts while they can. I'm sure it's all a lot more complicated than this but I'm just curious if the stock growth built on debt is a thing or just some other magic juice where growth spurts out of thin air, unrelated to actual liquidity.

FY2025 (ended June 2025), Seagate reported record revenue of $9.1 billion, up significantly from $6.55 billion in FY2024, driven by AI-fueled demand for high-capacity storage. Q1 FY2026 (ended Oct. 2025) saw $2.63 billion in salesa 21% YoY surge and non-GAAP EPS of $2.61, exceeding estimates, with shares jumping 19% post-earnings. Gross margins hit 36.2%, bolstered by cost discipline and a $5 billion share repurchase program. Analysts forecast 2025 revenue at $9.55–$9.85 billion and EPS of $8.60–$9.06, with market cap at \\~$47 billion.Seagate dominates the HDD sector, holding \\~40–41% unit market share in 2025, in a duopoly with Western Digital (42%) and Toshiba (17–19%).

Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well. But growth stocks don't rely so much on EPS or revenue as long as they beat some other metric like subscriber count: Going from 1 million to 10 million subscribers means more revenue in the future. Value stocks do rely on earnings reports, investors look for wall street expectations to be beaten on both EPS & revenue.

Google just announced a major breakthrough in quantum computing. Their new algorithm called “Quantum Echoes” ran on their Willow 105‑qubit chip and reportedly achieved a 13,000× speed‑up over the best classical supercomputer for a targeted computation. That is a huge shift if it holds up. What really catches my eye is how this could reshape AI compute infrastructure. Today most of the AI narrative is about GPUs, data centers and training massive models. Nvidia dominates in that world. But if quantum hardware becomes practical at scale, the entire compute stack – from chips to cloud to software – could pivot. Google already links Quantum Echoes to real‑world applications like molecular modeling and materials science, even drug discovery. In contrast, Nvidia’s story is brilliant and likely still valid in the near term, but it might be structured around the current paradigm of GPU‑first compute. If the paradigm shifts, Nvidia might face more competition or structural limit. Meanwhile, Google is quietly moving on the underlying compute frontier. Their blog says this demonstration is a step toward “real‑world applications of quantum computing” and not just academic fireworks. From an investment perspective this means one of two things: either Google’s quantum efforts take years to pay off (in which case Nvidia remains the safer bet) or we’re at the beginning of a compute inflection and Google is underpriced for the long term. Given how many institutions are locked into GPU chains already, the transition won’t be overnight, but the potential upside looks significant.", "title": "Why I care more about Google than NVDA", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1okiujw/why_i_care_more_about_google_than_nvda/", "author": "BernKurman", "score": 0, "subreddit": "stocks", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:15Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:15.713585"}

What just went down this week: The long-anticipated Fubo + Hulu Live TV merger received final approval. Disney now effectively controls ~70% of Fubo. Locked shares mean no new dilution for the next two years, so public float remains unchanged and tight. With Hulu Live + Fubo now united under the Disney umbrella, they suddenly have real scale to compete against YouTube TV in live sports streaming. Meanwhile, Disney and YouTube TV failed to renew their carriage agreement — meaning YouTube TV just lost Disney channels (ESPN, ABC, etc.) right as Disney backs Fubo. Pretty insane timing, and the competitive implications here are big. Why I’m bullish: YouTube TV dropping Disney content leaves a massive subscriber gap, especially sports fans who want ESPN. Social chatter + search traffic around Fubo has spiked hard — people are already hunting alternatives. Despite all this, the market is still pricing Fubo like some forgotten SPAC instead of a newly armed Disney streaming asset. Earnings are Monday morning. The conference call will likely give more details on integration plans, synergies, and growth roadmap now that the merger is official. Float remains tight for 2 years + rising institutional interest. My position: 1,000 shares 50 calls @ $4 exp next Friday 40 calls @ $5 exp Feb 2026 (Calls still look dirt cheap to me) TLDR: Disney now controls Fubo, and YouTube TV just lost Disney networks at the same time.

{"id": "1olwuw3", "created_at": "2025-11-01T19:36:26Z", "text": "[DD] Riot Platforms ($RIOT): From Bitcoin Mining to AI Data Centers — A Potential Inflection Point Riot Platforms ($RIOT) is in the middle of a structural transformation that may redefine how it is valued by the market. Historically known as one of North America’s largest Bitcoin miners, Riot is now positioning itself as an emerging player in AI and high performance computing (HPC) infrastructure. The company’s Corsicana, Texas facility spans roughly 858 acres and is approved for up to 1 gigawatt of power capacity, one of the largest single campus footprints of its kind in the United States. Earlier this year, Riot paused its planned 600 megawatt expansion for Bitcoin mining to evaluate converting that same capacity into AI and HPC data center use. Management hired a senior data center executive to lead the new division, engaged consultants to assess power and cooling suitability, and began construction on two buildings totaling approximately 112 megawatts of IT capacity. This is not speculation; it is active development backed by land, power, and infrastructure that are already in place. The timing of this move is significant. AI workloads and large language models require enormous power density, and data center operators with access to cheap, scalable energy have become strategic assets. Traditional data center REITs such as Equinix (EQIX) and Digital Realty (DLR) trade at far higher valuation multiples because of their recurring revenue models and long term tenant contracts. Riot is attempting to bridge that gap by repurposing part of its mining infrastructure into AI ready hosting capacity, potentially converting volatile crypto linked income into stable infrastructure revenue. From a technical standpoint, Riot’s stock has shown notable volatility but also signs of accumulation and bullish inflection. The price has risen over 100% in the past year, from a 52 week low near $6.20 to recent highs approaching $23.90. After a pullback into the $19–$20 range, the stock is currently testing support near its 50 day moving average, while maintaining a rising 200 day trend, a configuration that often precedes continuation moves when momentum returns. [reference attached image] Financially, Riot remains in a strong position relative to peers. First quarter 2025 revenue reached $161 million, nearly double year over year growth. The balance sheet carries modest leverage, and the company continues to expand its power infrastructure without taking on excessive debt. Bitcoin mining remains the primary revenue driver today, but the data center pivot provides long term optionality for recurring revenue and business model diversification. Analyst consensus price targets currently sit around $23–$25, which lines up with short term resistance levels. However, the long term valuation potential could be far greater if Riot successfully transitions from a mining company to an infrastructure platform. A single large scale AI tenant or power lease agreement could unlock a market re rating toward data center multiples, representing a meaningful shift in how investors view its earnings stability and growth prospects. To understand the upside potential, it helps to compare Riot to the current market leaders. Equinix (EQIX) trades at roughly 80 times earnings, and Digital Realty (DLR) trades at about 60 times earnings. Both are valued based on stable recurring revenue from hosting tenants, not on volatile commodity cycles. Riot currently trades closer to 10–12 times forward earnings, largely because it is still viewed as a Bitcoin miner. If Riot can convert just part of its 1 gigawatt power footprint into contracted AI hosting, it could justify a five to seven times multiple expansion over time. That would imply a potential valuation of $40 billion to $55 billion, roughly a 7x upside from its current $8 billion market capitalization if the market begins valuing Riot as an infrastructure company rather than a crypto proxy. In the near term, investors should watch for confirmation of AI or enterprise customer agreements, updates on the Corsicana build out timeline, and continued strength in Bitcoin pricing, which still impacts Riot’s cash flow. If the company delivers tangible progress on the AI front, the stock could break out of its current consolidation range and begin a sustained uptrend supported by both narrative and fundamentals. Riot Platforms is no longer just a Bitcoin miner chasing block rewards. It is evolving into an energy and infrastructure company with a significant role in powering the next generation of compute demand. The transformation is still in the early stages, but the foundation is being built, and the market is starting to take notice. For long term investors, this is the type of inflection point opportunity that can reshape valuation multiples and potentially deliver exponential returns. I’ve also included my current holdings with Riot as of Nov 1, 2025. Not financial advice. Do your own research.

It’s been around forever as the go to online checkout, though now there are other options like Apple Pay, Zelle and more. PayPal also owns Venmo. Growth hasn’t been huge. Year over year user growth is only around 1 percent, so it’s not exactly the hottest stock in the market. But, I think that will re-accelerate. But last week, PayPal announced a partnership with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. ChatGPT has a billion active users who will now be able to easily buy and sell through ChatGPT using PayPal. Even better, eligible transactions come with PayPal’s Purchase Protection and Seller Protection. This means users get the convenience of PayPal’s wallet in Instant Checkout, with multiple funding options like bank, balance, or card, plus tracking, dispute resolution, and all the protections PayPal buyers and sellers value. PayPal will also connect its global merchant network to OpenAI, creating a platform for tens of millions of small businesses as well as the largest brands in the world to sell within ChatGPT. I think this has the potential to add a ton of new active users for PayPal, growth that the market isn’t currently pricing in. Right now, PayPal trades at a PE of 13.25, which is really cheap. Forward PE is 11.9. They are also putting all of their free cash flow into buying back shares, rewarding shareholders consistently. On average, they increase the supply by just 10 percent per year, so shareholders see real value. The CEO is young and forward thinking. He even consults his kids, who are in college, on trends in AI and how to push Venmo and other innovations. I think PayPal is well-positioned to be one of the winners as AI becomes a bigger part of commerce.

I'm sure like 5 people remember my last post from a year ago where I broke down my entire strategy. I won't be doing that again, but here's an update on how it performed. Overall up +32% which is slightly better than QQQ's +29%. I didn't even come close to TQQQ's +63% this time around and the cause is pretty clear... XLP flopped big time. I know it's a hedge so in a way it's supposed to underperform when everything is at all time highs but to underperform THIS much? It felt like I was hedging my calls with puts. I could speculate that there's some global macroeconomic shift away from consumer staples or something but I didn't get here by doing that kind of DD. I just backtested historical returns. https://preview.redd.it/8oih97uutgyf1.png?width=414&format=png&auto=webp&s=99e35321eff36d599934739ea8de4f8d9c0227c1 On an unrelated note, I find it hilarious that some haters bookmarked my post and showed up to say \"told you so\" around liberation day. Yeah I was down -$167k at the time but I've seen worse and that ended up being a nothing burger. Turns out when your calls have 1-2 years until expiry those temporary setbacks don't matter much. Moving forward, I think I'm done with options. I'm sure we've all seen those posts where people hit it big and make life changing money but don't know when to quit. There's this dismissive attitude like \"if you can't quit your day job right this instant then it's not enough money\" but that's just not true. All time (since 2018) I'm up +$415k which is a massive head start and is plenty to snowball into retirement from here even in shares. Maybe if my goal were to hit a high score of millions of dollars I'd keep YOLOing 50% of my portfolio into LEAPS every year but I just want a comfy normal life. https://preview.redd.it/q6lgexe0vgyf1.png?width=418&format=png&auto=webp&s=54b663478b678b636f52228f06b7ccf47cce7e70 If you backtest retirement strategies (which I've done a lot of) the ones that fail happen when you hit your target number due to some bubble, quit your job, then immediately stuff crashes back down like in 2000 or 2008. Moving to safer investments early and planning to work a while longer should both protect against that in case we're in a bubble right now. It's been fun. We'll see if I have anything worth posting next year but probably not.

Between 2009 (post-2008 correction) and 2025, the annual growth has been 15% a year, so less per year but over a much longer period (16 years). The 2008 financial crisis was a drop of 50% of the S&P500. Losing gains of the last 4 years would mean a 15% drop for the S&P500. Average recovery time of the last 4 market crashes was almost 4 years. If the top 10 largest US valuations (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple etc.) dropped by 25%, a global index tracker would drop by 5%, the S&P500 would drop by 8%. For a drop of 50%, a global index tracker would drop by 10%, the S&P500 would drop by 16%. Of course, if the top 10 largest US valuation dropped by 50%, you would also expect many other companies to drop significantly due to negative sentiment. My conclusions: * Don't just invest in the S&P500 if you fear the top 10 US valuations are very inflated (AI bubble).

But one of its rivals—the Amazon-backed developer Anthropic—has a clearer path to making a sustainable business out of AI. > >Anthropic and OpenAI do similar things: They develop advanced AI models upon which chatbots, image generators and a host of other AI tools are based. > >But they have approached the question of how to generate revenue—and, one would hope, profit—from AI in different ways. > >Outside of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, which integrates OpenAI’s models into Microsoft’s software products, OpenAI mostly caters to the mass market. Its user base is, in large part, replacing search-engine queries with bot conversations, which has proved immensely popular. ChatGPT had more than 800 million weekly users as of this month, according to the company, which has helped OpenAI reach an annual revenue run rate of around $13 billion, around 30% of which it says comes from businesses. > >Anthropic has generated much less mass-market appeal. The company has said about 80% of its revenue comes from corporate customers. Last month it said it had some 300,000 of them. > >That focus has helped put Anthropic ahead of OpenAI among business users. Its cutting-edge Claude language models have been praised for their aptitude in coding: A July report from Menlo Ventures—which has invested in Anthropic—estimated via a survey that Anthropic had a 42% market share for coding, compared with OpenAI’s 21%. Anthropic is also now ahead of OpenAI in market share for overarching corporate AI use, Menlo Ventures estimated, at 32% to OpenAI’s 25%. > >Anthropic is also surprisingly close to OpenAI when it comes to revenue. The company is already at a $7 billion annual run rate and expects to get to $9 billion by the end of the year—a big lead over its better-known rival in revenue per user. > >Both companies have backing in the form of investments from big tech companies—Microsoft for OpenAI, and a combination of Amazon and Google for Anthropic—that help provide AI computing infrastructure and expose their products to a broad set of customers. > >But Anthropic’s growth path is a lot easier to understand than OpenAI’s. Corporate customers are devising a plethora of money-saving uses for AI in areas like coding, drafting legal documents and expediting billing. Those uses are likely to expand in the future and draw more customers to Anthropic, especially as the return on investment for them becomes easier to measure. > >Demonstrating how much demand there is for Anthropic among corporate customers, Microsoft in September said Anthropic’s leading language model, Claude, would be offered within its Copilot suite of software despite Microsoft’s ties to OpenAI. > >The mass-market consumer revenue model is more nebulous. OpenAI has yet to settle on a way to make money from it beyond charging subscription fees. It has a $20-a-month “plus” plan and $200-a-month “pro” plan for consumers, in addition to a free tier that comes with limits on queries and runs more slowly. Such subscription fees aren’t enough to offset the massive cost of developing and rolling out cutting-edge AI. > >The obvious revenue stream for OpenAI’s consumer business will be advertising. But it isn’t clear how OpenAI or its competitors would inject ads into chatbots. It won’t be as straightforward as search ads; users wouldn’t likely welcome brand placement in their bot chats. And as it looks for an ad-revenue model, OpenAI is in the unenviable position of competing with Google, which has its own suite of mass-market AI tools and far deeper roots in advertising. > >Of course, OpenAI is making a strong appeal to business customers too, both through Microsoft and on its own. And there is an argument that OpenAI’s vast user base and exposure to a wider set of queries will give it an edge among corporate users. > >Yet there is also a possibility that OpenAI’s mass-market appeal becomes a turnoff for corporate customers who want AI to be more boring and useful than fun and edgy. OpenAI recently said it would begin allowing adults to have erotic conversations with ChatGPT, and has urged for a hands-off approach to AI regulation. Even if the company makes its products more constrained in corporate contexts, its freewheeling reputation seems likely to limit its inroads. > >For all of OpenAI’s spending, meanwhile, Anthropic has shown it is as good or better in AI arenas that companies care about. Vals AI, a startup that evaluates AI models, ranks the latest version of Anthropic’s large language model Claude as top in a business-focused benchmark that brings together finance, legal and coding tasks. > >“Anthropic is laser-focused on these agentic enterprise use cases and they’re playing a very competitive game with OpenAI right now,” said Rayan Krishnan, a co-founder of Vals. > >OpenAI and its chief-executive-slash-showman Sam Altman have been hogging the AI spotlight lately. Anthropic’s business prospects—and the shrewdness of its main investors, Amazon and Google—may be more deserving of notice. > >(News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a content-licensing partnership with OpenAI.)", "title": "[WSJ] OpenAI’s Less-Flashy Rival Might Have a Better Business Model", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1olsas9/wsj_openais_lessflashy_rival_might_have_a_better/", "author": "Prudent-Corgi3793", "score": 135, "subreddit": "StockMarket", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:15Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:15.193845"}

{"id": "1okawh4", "created_at": "2025-10-30T20:34:10Z", "text": "These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days. This is why you can’t predict the markets. I made predictions for all the stocks in my portfolio. In just 10 days, a lot of them aged badly. To myself, and to you investors, don’t try to predict the market. My thesis: **Stock Positions 10/20/2025** **GOOG:** **Hold** after earnings when I will likely buy the stock **NEM:** While **tariffs devalue the U.S. dollar**, Gold is likely to **see record highs**. Interest rates are declining, which creates more inflation which will likely help NEM, which is a Gold miner, and gold miners are cyclical with the price of Gold. As worse data approaches the stock market (which is likely to come) Gold will keep making record highs. The USD devaluing + Interest rates likely being cut + an overvalued stock market + most other markets being overvalued is likely to allow NEM and Gold to continue to go up. Even though NEM has a large connection to Gold, NEM still must abide **by regulations** which could drag down the price, even if Gold is going up. Also, my MSR ratio shows NEM at 82/16 odds, which shows that NEM is highly overvalued on the (D) chart on TradingView. However, NEM has good leadership, and their **debt has reduced by 8.69B to 7.13B** (as of June 2025). Their debt-to-equity ratio is sound at 0.24. This is why I will **hold** NEM and wait for more earnings which are on Oct 23 2025 **NFLX:** Likely to continue with strong growth through Q3. Many analysts rate NFLX a buy before earnings and are increasing their price targets, especially after the release of some big hits (Squid Game 3, Kpop Demon Hunters). However, NFLX has fallen below its 50-day moving average of tomorrow’s earnings report. This should initiate caution to investors. Q3 has been a very good season for companies in the S&P 500. Out of the index, **12% of companies have had their earnings, with 86% surpassing expectations**. So far, this has been a fantastic quarter. NFLX is a big company and it’s likely to have a beat as well. Even though Q3 has been a good performance, **NFLX is exposed to the American consumer**, which if they feel the effects of inflation too harshly, might start to cancel their Netflix subscriptions. Also, Donald Trump, the president of the U.S said that he will **put 100% tariffs** on movies outside of the U.S, which would drastically affect NFLX’s profit margins, because **59% of all Netflix revenue comes from international markets.** Despite this, I believe that NFLX will continue to thrive and will likely beat earnings. This is why I will **buy** some NFLX before earnings tomorrow. **MU:** Earnings were fantastic. **Revenue surged up to 37.8B, nearly a 49% increase year-over-year.** Analyst targets range from $240 to $270, which is approximately a 20 – 30% upside. Although a fantastic earnings report, MU plans to **sever its chip business in China** after its ban in 2023 on its products in infrastructure. While it will still supply some things to China, this will likely, over **the long term hurt, revenue and revenue diversification**. MU has also been facing tariff headwinds **after the U.S added 10% universal tariffs** on all imports, which MU has suffered from. This is why I will **hold** until geopolitical tensions decrease. **If they increase, I will sell a chunk of my position**. I have already made 33% profit at the time of writing. **UNH:** One of the biggest healthcare / insurance service companies in the U.S, with exposure across insurance (UnitedHealthcare), health services, data and pharmacy benefits. This means it has multiple levers for revenue and margin improvement. It is an established network, relationships with other companies have been built over many decades (since 1977) **Investors like Warren Buffett and Michael Burry** have invested billions into UNH, seeing it as undervalued from recent highs. However, there is a reason for UNH being valued as ‘undervalued’. UNH have been facing rising medical costs, utilization and squeezed margins. The company has faced **a lot of uncertainty**, even at one point **suspending its 1-year outlook**. The company has faced **ongoing scrutiny into the investigation of Medicare billing practices and over adjustments**. This could bring **potential fines, reputational damages or operational constraints**. **The UNH CEO, who was shot in December 2024** caused turmoil in the company. Even though it’s been nine months since the shooting, it has scarred many investors, and customers about why the CEO was shot, and if UNH is doing bad practices at the company. For these reasons, I will likely **hold** the stock for the foreseeable future. **JNJ:** The stock has seen a good Q3 report, **sales up 6.8% year over year**. The growth came from its **“Innovative Medicine” and “MedTech”** segments, so its not overly reliant on one division. JNJ is also pushing new therapies into the markets, so its business is diverse. JNJ also revised down its **tariff expectations from $400M to $200M**, reflecting improved global trade conditions. The reason why I bought JNJ in the first place was because it was reliable and solid. It helped me hedge against market geopolitical volatility. Even though I like JNJ stock very much, key drugs **like Stelara (which is a big revenue driver) is losing its exclusivity or facing biosimilar competition** which could erode further revenue. After a strong run for JNJ, positive news might be priced in. Some valuation models say that **JNJ might be 4-5% overvalued** relative to its fundamentals. **In the worst-case scenario**, if a court hands down a massive talc verdict, or series of judgements JNJ could suffer an **earnings shock, cash flow and reputation**. This should keep investors cautioned of the future of JNJ. I will **hold** JNJ for these reasons until **further** **notice**. **BABA:** This stock has a lot of exposure to the AI market, **building the ‘compute’ layer**, which is for LLMs. It is e-commerce, but it could expand into technology through this. The stock has rallied in 2025, and some models **suggest that BABA is still undervalued**. BABA has **substantial cash reserves** for extra projects that could fuel revenue growth. Geopolitical tensions between the U.S and China has made created trouble for BABA. U.S scrutiny **because of U.S national security** concerns has impacted the valuation of the stock. While AI growth is exciting, Alibaba’s traditional services are under margin pressure. China is **dealing with a slowdown in economic growth, property stress and consumer spending being soft in many areas. Trade tensions may disrupt Alibaba**. Alibaba is also **viewed as a “comeback” and “transformation story”**, so there are high expectations, like any AI stock. Some analysts suggest most of the good news is already priced in. This is why I am going to **hold Alibaba until 11/21/2025**, when it has its earnings, and then I will do another analysis on the company then. **TSM:** This stock **manufactures** a large share of all **the most advanced chips in the world**, for big players **like NVDA and AMD**. Because it has such a large share, it has greater area **for growth and revenue expansion**. TSM has a moat in advanced technology which is extremely hard to replicate. **The accelerating demand for GPUs, AI accelerators, data centre chips, and related semiconductors benefits TSM**. TSM has had strong recent earnings. The leading edge that TSM has is **extraordinarily** **expensive to maintain**, for a company like TSM. If demand slows, then as the whole operation is so expensive, it could hurt TSM profitability. Geopolitical situation in Taiwan is delicate, because **if China declares war on Taiwan, the stock will likely drop a lot**. Cybersecurity and hacking is also meaningful in the semi conductor industry. Competition to remain the company with the most advanced chips is fierce, with Intel saying it will invest 33B euros and Samsung investing 11 – 16B dollars annually. I believe that TSM will continue to grow (no signs of growth slowing down) but if the AI bubble pops, and as China – US tensions grow (especially over Taiwan and tariffs) an invasion into Taiwan is not off the table. This is why I am cautious of TSMC’s future prospects. I am planning **to hold and buy small chunks** because of this earnings report and because of Post-Earnings-Announcement-Drift which will likely last a few more weeks. **MS:** The stock recently had a good Q3 performance, with their investment banking **revenue jumping 44% year over year. MS has also been given more flexibility to deploy capital, increase dividends or make investments, because the Federal Reserve has agreed to lower MS’ “stress capital buffer” from 5.1%, to 4.3% for the upcoming year.** Morgan Stanley is a big company, which has many diversified operations, like asset management, institutional securities, investment banking, trading and other operations which allows for multiple angles to expand revenue. However, much of their revenue comes from investment banking, so if just a handful of operations underperform, it could **affect MS and drag on profit margins**. MS is also exposed to the health **of credit markets** and the health of corporates, so if credit defaults rise, MS could face losses. Morgan Stanely would also be hurt, in the worst-case scenario, by a recession. In a recession, deal making, a large revenue driver would be hurt hart, causing a drag on MS. Given the moderate chance by most institutions of a recession coming in 2025/2026, trimming the position of MS might be a good idea. This is why I will **hold** until **recession fears are larger**. **JPM:** Similar to Morgan Stanley. I will **hold** until recession fears are larger. **UBER:** Uber has a **diversified business model**, (uber eats, normal driving, and AI services). This helps mitigate the risks associated with any single revenue stream. UBER faces regulatory scrutiny because of some drivers not being licensed. In Hong Kong, lawmakers have passed a bill to regulate this. **The FTC has taken action against UBER for deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its subscription, Uber One**. The legal challenge could result in fines and damage to Uber’s reputation. **Uber faces competition from Deliveroo and Just Eat, especially in the U.K.** This is why I will likely **hold, and if earnings are bad, sell some of my position.** **SPGI:** Standard and Poor’s. Had a good Q2 performance of 3.755B, a **6% increase year over year. The company also announced a 1.8B acquisition of With Intelligence, a private markets data provider. This will enhance SPGIs offerings, in the rapidly growing private financial market sector. Analysts maintain a “strong buy” rating for SPGI, with a 12-month price target averaging 609$ indicating a potential upside of \\~28%.** SPGI’s valuations are concerning. **The P/E ratio is at 36.3x,** which is above the industry average of 25.7x. DCF model suggest that a fair, closer value is 288$, indicating the stock may be overvalued. Like MS and JPM, market downturns could reduce demand for SPGI services and seeing as a recession has a moderate chance for 2025/2026, this is a possibility. Even though SPGI has concerning valuations, I think that I will allocate a large amount of money to SPGI before earnings. Right now, it is down -11% in my portfolio, but to me it, it suggests a buying opportunity, and as the stock has gone down a lot, the expectations for Q3 might be lower**. I will buy moderate chunks more SPGI**. Earnings on the 30^(th) of October 2025 **BKNG:** Earnings on the 28^(th) of October 2025. Booking Holdings has demonstrated **good financial results, with revenue growth being in the travel sector. BKNG is diversified, having many brands such as** [**Booking.com**](http://Booking.com)**, Agoda, KAYAK and OpenTable, providing a broad range of services. The company has operations in 220 countries, meaning that it has a strong global presence.** Booking Holdings is exposed to currency exchange rate volatility, which may impact revenue. BKNG is also very economically sensitive, so in a recession, it is likely to be impacted very hard. An economic downturn is likely not good for BKNG. **The industry is highly competitive, with players like Expedia, Airbnb and other regional platforms wanting market share. BKNG has a beta of 1.35, so it’s more volatile than other stocks.** For these reasons, I will buy **a small amount of BKNG before earnings.** **BRK.B:** 70% increase in profits in operating earnings, driven by a substantial rise in insurance. Berkshire Hathaway has underperformed the S&P 500. I am not holding it to outperform the S&P 500, I am more holding it as a counterweight to more volatile stocks in my portfolio. Warren Buffet stepped down in 2025 which has been an issue for some investors, but I am confident in the leadership of Greg Abel. BRK.B is a very small position in my portfolio (because of Warren Buffet stepping down, and that turbulence) but the dust has likely settled, so I will **buy large chunks before earnings** (which is on the 3^(rd) of November, 2025). **DOW:** This stock has a strong history of dividends, which is why I bought it in the first place. It has a diverse revenue stream from multiple angles. The company is facing many lawsuits over misleading investors that it could withstand tariffs and sustain dividends. Analysts project that DOW **will have a loss of 0.31$** a share, a significant decline from the same quarter last year, that yielded positive profit per share. This is why I will likely **hold DOW through earnings, and see where things stand after earnings.** **OPEN:** Meme stock / speculative. **Hold / Sell before earnings report with the way things are going.** **AVGO: Strong Q3 performance, revenue of 15.95B, a 22% increase year over year. AI semiconductor revenue has surged to 63% year over year to 5.2B dollars, marking 10 consecutive quarters of growth.** AVGO has **a high P/E ratio of 89.3**, amidst this AI bubble, which is **worrying investors**. The company has also **had layoffs affecting sales, customer success, and account management roles, including VMware, which it acquired in late 2023. Even though AVGO had strong revenue, the stock still declined 4% following because it was not a good enough earnings report to please investors.** This is why I am **likely to hold till the next earnings report**. **NVDA:** Like AVGO, but they work in slightly different areas. **P/E ratio is 52, and the stock will be a hold until earnings.** **Sorry for the long essay!**", "title": "These were my short term predictions for the last 9-10 days.

They own Quest, OWYN, and Atkins brands of diet/health food. Stock is down big on a market overreaction to most recent ER. Company reported a paper loss of .12, but it’s all an accounting thing. They would have reported a profit of .45 or so, but they reassessed the value of their Atkins brand to be $60m lower than they were currently valuing it on the books. Revenue is in line, operating costs are in line mostly, marketing was a 9m savings over PY and they would have made 45m or so in profit if they didn’t assess down by 60m on the brands value for a 15m or so loss. OK, so I’m a degenerate and I was scrolling the 52 week new lows list looking for penny stock runners (if you haven’t noticed, every 150% top daily gainer this month has hit a 52 week low a few days prior). Anyways I scroll past this stock SMPL that is new to me, trading near $20. Ok I’m intrigued. So I check the chart and it’s decent, with a big drop in the past few days. Ok, what’s that. ER miss. Ok. What do they do? HOLY SHIT ITS QUEST BARS. Ok ok slow down. Check the financials and I’m surprised to see a healthy company on fundamental levels. Good earnings, profitable, healthy debt to assets, and just one big miss this quarter. Interesting, I wonder what happened so I go to the P&L and run down it quick. Healthy revenue, healthy cost of goods, 9m in saving YOY in marketing costs, good gross profit, and a single $60m charge for impairments. Weird. So I dig deeper a bit into their latest 10k to see what that is, and it’s a paper cost for a lowered asset valuation on Atkins, so their 45m or so in profit turns to a 15m loss, because accounting stuff. Alright the market overreacted to a paper loss when the normal business is solid as hell. Simply Good Foods (SMPL) reported a Q4 GAAP loss per share of $0.12, but this is entirely due to a one-time, non-cash impairment of about $60 million tied to re-valuing the Atkins brand and other intangible assets. Position: I’m in for $50k in shares and $1000 in options so far. Screenshots in comments. This one’s gonna be a banger. Should be worth $25-30 or more in my opinion, and OWYN brand (allergen free protein shakes and powder) is a huge growth opportunity.

{"id": "1olikzx", "created_at": "2025-11-01T08:24:05Z", "text": "Agree or Disagree? Boeing Is getting back to basics. It's About Time. An article by AL ROOT. CEO Kelly Ortberg has made the company investible again. Why shares could climb more than 25%. By Al Root Boeing went from a fairy tale to a tragedy in the blink of an eye. Now the story shifts to redemption — and it could pay off for the stock. Once viewed as the perfect cash-flow machine, Boeing has been through seven years of misery, largely of its own doing. Starting with the crash of two 737 MAX jets in 2018 and 2019, the company struggled to make headway with a corporate culture that had put engineering so far down its list of priorities that even the simple task of making sure the door on a plane was installed correctly seemed out of its reach after a blowout in January 2024. Just making planes had become a slog: At the end of last year, Boeing had delivered 265 737-model jets, less than half its annual target and down from 396 delivered in 2023. At Thursday's close, Boeing stock sat 55% below its March 2019 all-time high of $446.01. Sometimes, though, a leader emerges just when all hope seems to be lost. Kelly Ortberg has been that leader. Since being hired in July 2024 to replace Dave Calhoun, Ortberg, an engineer with decades of experience in the aerospace industry, has done the seemingly impossible: made Boeing stock investible again. He has improved supplier relations, shaken up management ranks, reallocated resources to new program development, and, perhaps most important, is spending more time in Seattle, near where the 737 MAX is produced. Boeing stock has gained 7% since he was named CEO. Though shares declined after Boeing's third-quarter earnings release on Wednesday, they look set to rise even further as Ortberg demonstrates that the company's resurgence is real. \"I love these stories,\" says Hightower Advisors Chief Investment Strategist Stephanie Link. \"Companies with good bones that have been so poorly run then get a good CEO.\" Boeing declined to make Ortberg available for this article. As much as Boeing's decline seems to start with the first MAX crash, the problems actually started nearly 30 years ago. In 1997, Boeing CEO Philip Condit and McDonnell Douglas head Harry Stonecipher orchestrated the merger of the two companies. While the deal was celebrated on Wall Street, it marked the start of Boeing's shift away from a focus on engineering planes toward financial engineering. Condit moved the company's headquarters from Seattle to Chicago in 2001, a move designed to de-emphasize the core commercial aerospace business by separating management from production. It was a questionable decision and a culture killer. Things took another hit under Jim McNerney, who took over in 2005 and admitted out loud that \"cowering\" employees motivated him. After a painful nine-week strike in 2008, Boeing broke ground on its nonunion plant in South Carolina, where it makes the 787 Dreamliner today. Under McNerney, Boeing's financial path was set. From 2011 to 2019, a period that covered the development of the MAX through its grounding, Boeing spent about $49 billion on research and development and new plants and equipment, amounting to about 6.2% of sales. Airbus spent about $52 billion, or 9.4% of sales, over the same span. Boeing returned some $59 billion to shareholders over that period, including about $40 billion on share repurchases, which decreased shares outstanding from roughly 751 million at the start of 2014 to 568 million at the end of 2018. It wasn't money well spent: Boeing was forced to sell some $16 billion in common shares at a paltry $143 apiece in October 2024 to help repair its ailing balance sheet. Boeing now has about 760 million shares outstanding, as well as convertible debt sold in October 2024. Nothing, however, was as damaging as the development of the 737 MAX, which was brought to market by CEO Dennis Muilenburg in 2017. Boeing decided to modify the existing 737 platform to respond quickly to Airbus' A320neo family of jets. It turned out disastrously, with two deadly crashes due to malfunctioning sensors and new flight-control software. The crashes grounded the MAX worldwide for almost two years, tanking Boeing's earnings and cash flow. Dave Calhoun took over for Muilenburg and managed to get the MAX recertified for commercial flight. He announced his departure shortly after an emergency-door plug blew out of a 737 MAX 9 jet while in flight on Jan. 5, 2024. \"At this point, everyone knows the story, right?\" says Yale School of Management lecturer Gautam Mukunda. \"[Boeing] has been brutally mismanaged for basically my entire adult life.\" Enter Ortberg. The first thing investors need to know about him is that he is an engineer. He joined Rockwell Collins in 1987, and became president and CEO in 2013. Collins was eventually acquired by United Technologies — now RTX — in 2018. Ortberg left the company in 2021, serving on corporate boards until Boeing came calling. Ortberg hasn't been afraid to reverse prior management's decisions. He has moved management back to Seattle so it could be near Boeing's workers. He raised cash by issuing stock and convertibles and selling portions of Digital Aviation Solutions to Thoma Bravo for more than $10 billion. He also stopped the development of the X-66 truss-braced-wing demonstrator plane — a futuristic concept designed to improve efficiency with long, thin wings — which might one day have produced technologies usable on a commercial jet, but was too far off to help in the next few years. Gone, too, is the imperial management style that projected confidence when everything seemed to be working, but came across as hubris when the company ran into trouble. \"We have seen a far less arrogant tone,\" says Vertical Research Partners analyst Rob Stallard, who is also a fan of new Chief Financial Officer Jay Malave, who came over from Lockheed Martin. \"This improvement has also been noted by customers and suppliers, with a number now commenting that they have much more faith in Boeing actually delivering on its projections.\" AeroDynamic Advisory aerospace consultant and managing director Richard Aboulafia called out two additional management changes as evidence of positive momentum: naming Stephen Parker to run Boeing's ailing defense business, and putting former Wisk CEO Brian Yutko, an MIT Ph.D. in aerospace, aeronautical, and astronautical engineering, in charge of commercial aircraft development. Ortberg \"isn't afraid of anyone with talent,\" Aboulafia says. He also isn't afraid to make nice when he has to. While 3,200 Boeing defense workers are currently striking in St. Louis, where the company makes the F-15 and F-18 fighter jets, its labor strife likely peaked with the seven-week strike that ended in November 2024. Current Boeing management could have offered more up front, says Yale's Mukunda, but a work stoppage might have been unavoidable, given the built-up animosity. Boeing workers won significant pay increases in their new four-year contract and a guarantee that the next narrow-body jet Boeing designs would be built in Washington state. Boeing still has many problems to solve. The company isn't expected to make a profit in 2025, marking seven consecutive years of losses. It's the worst current streak for a company in the S&P 500 and one of the worst streaks ever, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, which looked at the current components of the S&P 500. No company in the index has lost more money since 2019 than Boeing. But there are signs of improvement. Demand, for one, hasn't been a problem for Boeing or Airbus for a while. People like to fly, and the industry has survived shocks including 9/11, SARS, and Covid-19. Today, Boeing has more than 6,600 unfilled orders on the books. The issue has been meeting customers' needs for more planes. In the six years since the second tragic MAX crash in March 2019, Boeing has delivered about 2,200 jets. In the six years before the tragedy, Boeing delivered twice that many. Deliveries in 2025 should be about 600 jets, according to FactSet, up from fewer than 350 in 2024 but still nowhere near the 806 Boeing delivered in 2018. The Federal Aviation Administration capped 737 MAX production at 38 a month in the aftermath of the 737 MAX door-plug blowout. It recently raised the cap to 42 a month. Boeing will work toward 46 or 47 a month and, eventually, 50 MAX jets a month. Higher production could help it generate over $11 billion in free cash flow in 2028, Wall Street's current call. \"It's actually a pretty simple story at this point,\" says BofA Securities analyst Ron Epstein, who has a Buy rating on the stock. \"Can it deliver more airplanes? And if they can deliver more airplanes, they generate more cash.\" Projecting Boeing's financial performance still isn't easy. Since the second MAX crash, Boeing has missed Wall Street estimates about 70% of the time — often by a wide margin. That is unheard of. Apple, by comparison, has missed earnings about 10% of the time over that span, while GE Aerospace — a Boeing peer that has evolved from its own turnaround story into a must-own, industry-leading stock — missed earnings about 25% of the time. And Boeing just missed estimates once again. The company lost $7.14 a share during the third quarter, hit by a $4.9 billion charge related to the long-delayed 777x program, much worse than Wall Street's expectation of a $5 per share loss. Third-quarter sales, however, rose to $23.3 billion, up from $17.8 billion in the third quarter of 2024 and the third consecutive quarter of revenue beats. Boeing also delivered 160 commercial jets, up from 116 a year ago, and reported its first quarter of positive free cash flow since 2023. Valuing a mature company that hasn't made money in roughly seven years is complicated. BofA's Epstein uses \"normalized\" free cash flow of $11 a share to reach his $270 target — up 35% from a recent $200 — while Vertical's Stallard uses a combination of 2027 earnings and cash-flow multiples to reach the same valuation. Another way is to look at where Airbus trades on 2028 free cash flow. It earns a multiple of 22, and a comparative valuation implies a price of up to $300 for Boeing stock — up 50% — with the difference between that and today's value reflecting the need for investors to buy into the turnaround story. Other catalysts can build confidence, too. Boeing is working on certifying the 777X and the 737 MAX 7 and 10 — the 10 is a longer version of the 7 — for commercial service. Timing is uncertain and dependent on regulators, but all three planes should be ready for delivery to customers in 2026 or 2027. What is clear is that the Boeing story is at the \"end of the beginning,\" to use Stallard's words from when he upgraded the stock to Buy from Hold in September. He had downgraded shares in 2020, but cited supply-chain improvements, stability in the defense business, and Ortberg for his sunnier view of the stock. And as the old problems recede, Boeing will be able to turn to the future. That will mean designing a new plane — a risk but an opportunity, too. A new plane will necessitate using tens of billions of dollars in cash flow spread out over a few years, but it can also help restore the market share it lost to the Airbus A320neo family, which has 70% market share of deliveries since the A320neo and MAX jets entered service. Beyond market share, a new jet would be another step in putting engineering back at the center of the company, something that is long overdue. \"Boeing is no longer denying the need for its creation, and they are no longer denying that they are looking at options,\" AeroDynamic Advisory's Aboulafia says.

During the call, management will discuss the Rook I Project’s development, regulatory milestones, and recent exploration updates that matter to investors. NexGen Energy’s momentum has been hard to miss lately, with a recent surge fueled by anticipation around its upcoming project milestones and stronger financing connections. The stock has posted a 53% share price return over the past 90 days, and its one-year total shareholder return stands at 34%. This highlights a pattern of long-term outperformance and renewed investor confidence. With shares trading near all-time highs and recent financial updates on the horizon, investors have to ask whether NexGen’s current valuation reflects all of its future growth or if there is still a buying opportunity left on the table. **Price-to-Book of 8.7x: Is it justified?** With NexGen Energy’s price-to-book ratio at 8.7x, the share price trades far above both peer and industry benchmarks. This points to a potential premium. The price-to-book ratio compares a company’s market value to its book value. For resource developers like NexGen, this metric provides a quick snapshot of how much investors are paying relative to the company’s underlying assets and equity. This is especially relevant when profits are still out of reach. Based on the available figures, the market is pricing NexGen at a much higher level than both the Canadian Oil and Gas industry average (1.6x) and its peer group average (7.7x). This signals strong optimism, but also raises questions about whether such a premium is warranted given the absence of current profitability and revenue.", "title": "NexGen Energy (TSX:NXE) Valuation in Focus Ahead of Rook I Project and Q3 Conference Call", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreet/comments/1ol10d0/nexgen_energy_tsxnxe_valuation_in_focus_ahead_of/", "author": "Fluffy-Lead6201", "score": 1, "subreddit": "wallstreet", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:14Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:14.813898"}

Buyers seem active around this structure, maintaining the medium-term bullish bias as long as $105,400 holds firm. If BTC clears and sustains above $116,000, it could trigger a move toward $123,962 (intermediate resistance) and $131,200 (major resistance). A breakout beyond $123,900 would likely confirm bullish continuation. On the flip side, immediate support remains at $105,400, followed by $99,480. A daily close below $105,400 might open doors for a deeper pullback toward $99,480 — a level where we could see renewed accumulation.

NXXT’s reaction to the news was controlled: reclaim, hold, and probe higher-no frantic reversal. That behavior screams “participants believe the headline matters,” which is how you seed multi-day continuation. Your chart backs it up. The 1-hour shows acceptance in the $1.93-$1.98 band with the blue trendline angling into the low $2s. Beneath price, a wide FVG block in the upper-$1.80s offers a logical reload if we dip. RSI hovering mid-50s tells you we’re not stretched; there’s room if the story gets another nudge. Volume also did the right thing-expansion on pushes, contraction on pauses. The story is easy to digest: turn a 300-acre park into a mini-utility with microgrids, storage, software, and charging, while fueling covers the transition. That clarity is why both investors and retail showed up. Convert the MOU to a binding agreement and you’ve got fuel for a grind that can extend into late Q4 2025.

Despite holding **76 million boe of 2P reserves**, a **net-cash balance sheet**, and multiple operated hubs on the Norwegian Continental Shelf, the company trades at just **0.1× 2027E EBITDA** and around **USD 0.84 per boe** – levels normally reserved for distressed assets. The disconnect is simple: * Dividend payments were **temporarily suspended in 2024** to fund two major projects – the **Bestla tie-back to Brage** and **Draugen electrification**. * High capex in 2025–26 (USD 330–365 m p.a.) obscures what happens when those projects finish. * With limited analyst coverage and a tight float (46 % held by BCPR), most institutional investors aren’t paying attention. Using NHG modelling based on current company guidance through 2026, we estimate the following shifts in 2027: * **Production rises \\~30 %** as Bestla comes onstream. * **Capex falls \\~60 %**, from USD 330 m to \\~USD 130 m. * Opex per boe declines as volumes rise.

This research shows the most recent prescription trends of the two companies' products. It appears that from June-Sept 2025, overall Semaglutide prescriptions increased 2.01%, Tirzepatide increased 8.36%, Liraglutide increased 17.02%, and Dulaglutide decreased 5.64%. For those not aware, NVO's products are Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and Liraglutide (Saxenda, Victoza); Eli Lilly's are Tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) and Dulaglutide (Trulicity). There are also generic versions of Liraglutide, besides NVO's products. This data further breaks down prescriptions by Anti-Diabetic Medication (ADM) or Anti-Obesity Medication (AOM). This breakdown is particularly interesting to me, as it shows Semaglutide getting a 14.39% increase in anti-obesity medications (AOM); Liraglutide saw a 38.80% increase in AOM; and Tirzepatide saw a 3.55% increase in AOM. The Anti-Diabetic Medications were not as favorable for NVO, as Semaglutide saw a 1.96% decrease in AOM, while Tirzepatide saw a 14.66% increase. With this most recent data, it is clear than NVO is experiencing stiff competition with LLY, but overall prescriptions have increased in this time frame nonetheless. I believe a significant reason for this increase is the adoption of Wegovy by CVS as the preferred GLP-1, effective in July 2025. Source: [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novo-nordisk-announces-that-cvs-caremark-the-countrys-largest-pbm-has-decided-wegovy-will-be-the-preferred-glp-1-medicine-covered-for-obesity-on-its-template-formularies-302443603.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/novo-nordisk-announces-that-cvs-caremark-the-countrys-largest-pbm-has-decided-wegovy-will-be-the-preferred-glp-1-medicine-covered-for-obesity-on-its-template-formularies-302443603.html) Please let me know your thoughts on the data, I am curious how others may interpret it. I think that if the pill version of Wegovy is approved in the coming days or weeks, that should also improve the prescriptions for Semaglutide in the future, especially in light of the CVS deal making Wegovy the preferred GLP-1. What is becoming clearer to me from this data is that access to GLP-1's is difficult and costly for many, which is why unfortunately many prescriptions for these drugs go unfilled. Insurance coverage, access (via Costco, CVS, etc.), out of pocket cost, expanding indications, and other factors may be important considerations in the future for getting these prescriptions filled.", "title": "NVO and LLY - Trends in GLP-1 Prescriptions June-Sep 2025 (Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, Liraglutide, etc)", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1om97cl/nvo_and_lly_trends_in_glp1_prescriptions_junesep/", "author": "chrislink73", "score": 59, "subreddit": "ValueInvesting", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:14Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:14.736476"}

But let’s have a look at what actually happened, except the stock price getting shitted on. The Q3 organic revenue growth was +1% (Merchant Solutions + 5%, Financial Solutions - 3%). Management reset 2025 guidance to 3.5% - 4% organic growth and $8.50–$8.60 adjusted EPS and launched a “One Fiserv” action plan to refocus on clients and invest for growth. They also announced leadership changes (new CFO Paul Todd) and are moving the listing to Nasdaq. Does that create value or is FI a shiny poop?💩 The multiple is washed out. At $66, against guided $8.50~$8.60 EPS, FI trades at roughly ~7.8× forward earnings. That is cheap for a global payments/software utility with sticky revenues. (Math: $66 ÷ $8.55 = 7.8×.) In 2024 Fiserv generated $6.63B operating cash flow and spent $1.57B on capex (from the 10‑K). That is approz $5.06B in classic free cash flow (OCF – capex) or ~$9.0 per share using the reported 561.3M shares outstanding 13–14% free‑cash‑flow yield at today’s price. Even after a softer 2025 YTD cash flow (company reported $2.88B free cash flow for the first nine months), the through‑cycle cash generation is significant. Also, they repurchased $5.4B of stock in the first nine months of 2025 (29.1M shares) and $1.0B in Q3 alone (7.2M shares). Which means, at 66 dollarinos, each $1B buys back ~15M shares is about 2.7% of the company. Even a more modest pace could shrink the share count materially and lift per‑share EPS/FCF. With expectations cut and the stock price being DOODOOED on💩💩, the hurdle to surprise on the upside is lower. Management’s plan focuses on client service, Clover small‑business solutions, and operational excellence (including AI). These are the right levers for this franchise. Keep in mind these moves include expanding Clover into Canada via a TD Bank merchant deal and tuck‑ins like CardFree practical. Also, commerce keeps digitising and cash continues to lose share to card/account‑to‑account payments. FI’s scale and distribution put it in the flow of funds. Management is also pushing new rails eg a stablecoin platform and a N Dakota bank partnership that serve as free options on future growth. PRICE QUICK Maths If FI merely hits the new midpoint ($8.55), and the market assigns a still‑conservative 10× multiple once the dust settles, that’s ~$86. At 12× ~$103. At a still modest 15× (below many software‑enabled payment peers historically), ~$128. None of these assume heroics, just freaking stabilization and a normalizing multiple on a reset base. Using the reported 2024 cash generation (OCF–capex), you degens are paying ~7.4× trailing owner earnings. If the company devoted even $1–2B/yr to buybacks at these levels (less than YTD pace), that alone could retire ~3–5% of shares annually, boosting per‑share compounding. Execution beats the lowered bar. Even mid single digit organic growth with disciplined costs would support the $8.50–$8.60 EPS range and restore confidence. So, at ~$66, you are paying ~7.8× the lowered 2025 EPS guide and getting a business that historically mints cash (2024 OCF–capex ≈ $5.1B) with meaningful buyback capacity. If execution simply stabilizes, a re‑rating to 10–12× earnings over time is very reasonable, with buybacks as a tailwind. That’s why I view FI at ~$66 as a strong value buy. PS.

Just replace [Company X] by the ticker. // Create a comprehensive fundamental analysis of Company X using the valuation and assessment principles of Peter Lynch and Warren Buffett. Use only reliable and up-to-date sources such as SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q), the company’s website, Yahoo Finance, Bloomberg, Morningstar, or sector analyst reports (e.g., S&P or Moody’s). Always cite your sources and data dates for transparency. If data is conflicting, prioritize official filings. Present the analysis in a clear, structured format with headings, subheadings, tables, and charts for readability. Keep it objective, base conclusions on data, and avoid unnecessary details. Use simple language wherever possible, so that a broad audience, including a 15-year-old, can understand the analysis. 1. Business Model • Explain Company X’s business model in simple terms, so that a 15-year-old can understand it. Describe what the company does, how it makes money, and why it is important in its sector. 2. Competitive Analysis and MOAT • Examine what makes Company X attractive compared to competitors. Is there a clear MOAT (sustainable competitive advantage)? Perform a Porter’s Five Forces analysis to assess the attractiveness of the industry (threat of new entrants, bargaining power of suppliers and customers, substitutes, and rivalry among existing competitors). • Compare Company X’s financial ratios (P/E, P/B, ROE, ROA, etc.) with those of at least two direct competitors and the sector average to determine whether the company is relatively under- or overvalued. Present this comparison in a table. 3. Management and Corporate Governance • Analyze the management team: review their track record, strategic decisions, compensation structure (e.g., alignment with shareholders through stock options), and insider trading activity over the past 12 months. • Evaluate corporate governance: shareholder-friendly actions (such as share buybacks, dividend policy, transparency in communication), board diversity, and any controversies (e.g., lawsuits or ethical issues). 4. Business Strategy and Lynch Classification • Analyze Company X’s business strategy. Classify the company according to Peter Lynch’s categories (e.g., fast grower, stalwart, turnaround, slow grower, asset play) and explain how this classification affects the investment case. • Add a SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) based on the collected data, and link this to the Lynch classification and risk factors. 5. Innovation and Product Pipeline • Analyze R&D spending as a percentage of revenue, patents, and the product pipeline (e.g., new approvals or trials, depending on the sector). Assess how these factors contribute to future growth and the MOAT. 6. Risk Factors • Identify risk factors, including external risks such as macroeconomic trends (e.g., sector-specific trends like aging population or spending patterns), regulation, and ESG factors (environmental, social, governance). Explain how these affect long-term prospects. • Dive deeper into ESG by analyzing specific metrics (e.g., carbon footprint, diversity statistics, board independence). Use ESG ratings from sources such as MSCI or Sustainalytics and evaluate how ESG influences access to capital. 7. Brand Reputation and Customer Perception • Analyze brand reputation and customer perception based on public sources (e.g., customer reviews, social media, market research). Explain how this affects the company’s attractiveness. 8. Recent Developments • Analyze recent news, earnings call transcripts (from the last 2 quarters), and analyst opinions (e.g., consensus target price and ratings from Wall Street analysts). Identify any catalysts such as partnerships, acquisitions, or new product launches. 9. Financial Analysis Use the most recent quarterly and annual figures for a detailed financial analysis. Present the data in tables and charts for clarity. Analyze historical performance over the past 3–5 years for key ratios (net profit margin, ROE, revenue growth, free cash flow) and present these trends in a table or chart. Conduct a forward-looking analysis for the next 3 years, including optimistic, neutral, and pessimistic scenarios, based on realistic assumptions such as sector forecasts and a break-even analysis for profitability. Present these scenarios in tables and charts. Financial Metrics 1. Profitability • Net Profit Margin • Gross Profit Margin • Return on Equity (ROE) • Return on Assets (ROA) 2. Liquidity and Solvency • Current Ratio • Quick Ratio • Debt-to-Equity Ratio • Altman Z-Score for bankruptcy risk 3. Valuation • Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E) • Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B) • Dividend Yield • EV/EBITDA and PEG Ratio 4. Growth • Revenue Growth • Earnings Growth • Free Cash Flow (FCF) 5. Efficiency • Revenue per Employee • Inventory Turnover • Asset Turnover 6. Cash Flow and Balance Sheet • Operating Cash Flow • Total Debt • Cash Position 7. Market and Sector Context • Market Share • Sector-Specific Ratios Valuation • Perform a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis to estimate intrinsic value and compare it to the current stock price. Conduct a sensitivity analysis on the DCF by varying key assumptions (e.g., growth rate ±2%, discount rate ±1%) and present this in a table. Compare the DCF with alternative valuation methods such as EV/EBITDA and PEG ratio. 10. Investment Conclusion • Summarize the analysis in a clear investment case. Provide a buy/hold/sell recommendation with a target price range based on the DCF and comparisons.

Management’s *base case* targets **$300M in EBITDA by 2030**, *excluding* any contribution from nuclear fuel, HALEU, or waste remediation. The story isn’t about uranium hype — it’s about execution. Three operational “flywheels” are spinning up right now: **1. Silicon-28** – early quantum & semiconductor revenue engine **2.** **Medical Isotopes** – scalable healthcare products feeding Lu-177 & Tb-161 therapies **3. Low-Cost + Vertical Integration** – Iceland plants + PET Labs pharmacies = high-margin moat If even half the plan materializes, upside could still be 50%+ from current levels. **Management Case Overview** # 🎯 Target * **$300M consolidated EBITDA by 2030** * *Excludes*: QLE, HALEU, uranium enrichment, waste-to-value business * Based purely on the **isotope segment** The roadmap is credible, because each segment can stand alone — but they reinforce one another when scaled together (2026–2029). # ⚙️ Flywheel #1 — Silicon-28: The Quantum Catalyst ASPI is the **world’s only commercial supplier of enriched Silicon-28 (Si-28)** — a material that drastically improves semiconductor and quantum computing performance. **Why it matters:** * Si-28 has 150% higher thermal conductivity * Reduces decoherence in quantum processors * Used in solid-state quantum computing & advanced semiconductors **Execution goals (2026–2027):** * Deliver kilogram-scale volumes *on time and on spec* * Publish 3rd-party purity validation * Convert at least 1 initial contract into a larger follow-on + win a 2nd marquee customer Once that credibility is earned, scaling becomes the driver. Each new Iceland module lowers energy cost per unit and boosts margin. If Si-28 production hits **20–30 kg/year by 2030**, revenues alone sit comfortably in the **nine-figure range**, with high margins. # 💉 Flywheel #2 — Medical Isotopes: The Healthcare Engine ASPI’s medical isotope platform targets **radiotherapeutics and diagnostics** — a fast-growing $10B+ global market. **Primary therapy driver:** * **Ytterbium-176 → Lutetium-177 (Lu-177)**, used in prostate & neuroendocrine cancer treatment **Other isotopes enable diversification and stable base sales:** * **Nickel-64 → Copper-64** (PET diagnostics) * **Gadolinium-160 → Terbium-161** (next-gen therapy isotope) * **Zinc-68 → Gallium-68 / Copper-67** (diagnostics) No single product carries the segment — the strategy is to keep enrichment lines fully utilized while one therapy product scales to commercial levels. **Targets:** * Commission new enrichment lines (2025–2026) * Convert LOIs into take-or-pay contracts * Pass first GMP & regulatory audits If one therapy isotope (e.g., Tb-161 or Lu-177) scales, and 2–3 diagnostics reach steady multi-million revenue, the medical segment could **match or exceed Si-28 by decade-end**. # ⚡ Flywheel #3 — Cost Advantage & Integration This is ASPI’s structural moat. Their **Iceland facilities** have access to geothermal and hydro energy at **1/5th to 1/7th the global average cost** — and electricity is the #1 cost input for isotope enrichment. **Advantages:** * Persistent cost leadership * Flexible allocation between isotope lines * Resilience during pricing shifts Meanwhile, **PET Labs** (ASPI’s radiopharmacy division) creates **vertical integration**: Enriched isotopes → converted into medical doses → directly sold to hospitals. That adds downstream margin and smooths revenue volatility. **Execution steps:** * Get first Iceland module live by mid-2026 * Add new modules steadily through 2029 * Acquire 1–2 additional pharmacies to scale the PET Labs template Goal: **40–50% EBITDA margins** at the pharmacy level as internal isotope sourcing increases. # Putting It Together |Segment|EBITDA Potential by 2030|Key Drivers| |:-|:-|:-| || |Silicon-28|$100–150M|Volume, purity, 2nd customer| |Medical isotopes|$100–150M|Therapy adoption + diagnostics| |Cost & integration|$50M+|Iceland scale, PET Labs, efficiency| |**Total (ex-QLE)**|**\\~$300M EBITDA**|Achievable through 2029| No value is assigned to: * QLE (uranium fuel & HALEU) * Waste remediation (One 30 Seven) * Future nuclear fuel partnerships So this $300M case is **purely isotopes**. **Valuation Sensitivity** If *only 50%* of the $300M EBITDA plan is achieved: * EV/EBITDA = 10× → \\~**+50% upside** vs current levels * IRR ≈ **8%** (conservative case) Management calls their plan *“100–200% conservative”*, so this should be viewed as a **floor, not a ceiling**.", "title": "[DD] ASP Isotopes (ASPI) — Building a $300M EBITDA Isotope Powerhouse", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/ValueInvesting/comments/1ols11h/dd_asp_isotopes_aspi_building_a_300m_ebitda/", "author": "meesterplussr", "score": 0, "subreddit": "ValueInvesting", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:14Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:14.616430"}

This is extremely sus; the market is irrationally pricing out future growth.

Now that's it's doing terrible, people find reasons to not buy it. In my humble opinion, this downtrend is mostly due to transitory effects (mostly DJT tariffs threats).

Meta has been doing 20-55% a year in earnings growth and yet now analysts are only predicting 8.6% to 16% earnings growth ? The results last week was a 82% decline in earnings due to a one time tax treatment. And this had an impact on future CAGR calculations. b. So what growth rates to take (LEVER) and from what base ? To be conservative, i will choose the growth rates from 9% to 12% this is rather conservative especially when compared to what Meta has been doing. The base i will start will the the estimate full year dec 2025 EPS nos. There are several and i will take the lower of 28.90 and 28.59. **Assumptions**: the discount is 9%, long term growth rates (terminal growth) is 3%, duration of abnormal growth (9% to 12%) is 10 years.

{"id": "1oliks9", "created_at": "2025-11-01T08:23:41Z", "text": "Fiserv (NYSE: FI) crash gives huge buy opportunity! After its brutal Q3-2025 reset (the company’s worst trading day on record), Fiserv’s stock has been priced as if the franchise were in structural decline. The company cut its full-year revenue growth outlook from ~10 % to 3.5–4 % and EPS from $10.20 to about $8.55, triggering its worst trading day on record. From their Q3 call, we understand the last 2 year growth was explained by Argentina and the company was posting a low single digit already ex-Argentina. This explains a large part of the revise guidance. Their SMB business Clover was posting 10% growth till Q3 where it falls to 5% for that quarter. Yet behind the emotional sell-off, the fundamentals of one of the world’s leading payments platforms remain almost intact. A fintech powerhouse in transition. Fiserv operates three strong pillars: (1) Merchant Solutions (Clover for SMBs, Carat for enterprises), (2) Financial Technology for banks and credit unions, and (3) Payments & Network Services covering card processing and digital rails. With more than 10,000 financial-institution clients and millions of merchants, over 80 % of revenue is recurring. The business is mostly software-oriented, and it doesn’t deal with lending or issuing cards. Roughly half of revenue comes from Merchant Acceptance (Clover point-of-sale hardware & software, e-commerce gateways, gift/loyalty programs). First growth engine, Fiserv’s Clover payment-processing platform has been the biggest growth driver, but growth has been slowing down which is one of the attention point. The other half of revenues is Financial-institution technology (core bank-processing, card-issuing platforms, risk and compliance tools, digital-banking apps) Second major growth engine is Fiserv’s DNA platform which remains the leading core system for large credit unions serving over 1,200 credit unions with about 27% market share. Despite some client losses and market share erosion, DNA’s modern, scalable technology and continuous enhancements keep it preferred. Awards in 2024 and major client upgrades, like First Community Credit Union, underline DNA’s strength. And finally, the revenues includes a fast-growing Payments & Network unit (Zelle, debit processing, real-time ACH, prepaid). Because revenue is mostly fee-per-transaction or long-term SaaS contracts, the model is highly recurring and cash-generative. What went wrong in Q3? The reset exposed temporary distortions—Argentina’s hyper-inflation artificially inflated growth, while margin expansion in Merchant stalled. Leadership turnover after Frank Bisignano’s exit deepened uncertainty. But the business itself didn’t collapse; it merely faced a credibility gap. Why it collapse? New management slashed previous full-year earnings guidance (profit warning) and said it won’t be able to deliver on previous promises to investors. Many value investors had entered earlier in Q2 of which big names like Michael Lowenstein, Michael Platt, Seth Klarman, Ray Dalio, and David Shaw which they probably check the long term market position. Why new leadership matters. CEO Mike Lyons, appointed in May 2025, brings a rare mix of banking scale and strategic discipline. Former President of PNC Financial Services and ex-Global Head of Corporate Development at Bank of America, he knows how to integrate platforms and execute through volatility. His “One Fiserv” plan—simplifying operations, refocusing on clients and core products, and renewing governance—is precisely what a mature fintech needed. To my understanding, Fiserv operates a powerful cash machine driven by >80% recurring revenue from core processing (DNA), payments (Clover), and issuer services (Carat). Its sticky, long-term contracts with financial institutions and merchants ensure predictable, high-margin cash flow. Today, it is at the right level of valuation, plus margin of safety due to recent panic. Catalysts ahead. Watch for: (1) early proof of margin stabilization and re-acceleration in Merchant (2) improved investor confidence as leadership executes (3) normalization of Argentine exposure (4) continued buybacks under the 60 million-share authorization. Risks. Execution slippage on the Clover/Carat migration, another guidance cut, or faster innovation by Adyen or Stripe could weigh further. [Add: recession could impact marchand division due to lower expected purchase]. At ~8-9× forward EPS—half the multiple of peers like Visa, Mastercard, or Adyen—Fiserv’s valuation already prices in failure and absence of growth. A rerating to even 12–13× could unlock 50 % upside within 18 months, if margins and confidence normalize. Bottom line. To my view, Fiserv is not (yet) broken, only mispriced after an emotional shock and new reality about their future growth trajectory (-50% in 2 days!). From exuberance to reality. Nice in this current market to pay the right price, even at a good bargain (most probably), aligning more to competitors like FIS and Jack Henry. This seems to be a asymetric bet based on a crisis-level valuation, more chance to get up than to decrease further...unless ......you believe Clover is loosing to competition and their banking solution DNA is doomed to lose its 2,500 customers quickly. My impression after this analysis: Fiserv is trading at materially lower multiples than at the time of the 2019 First Data deal despite a larger, more profitable, less leveraged platform today. Underlying market drivers: 1) Fiserv’s growth is fueled by the expansion of e-commerce and digital payments, which drives higher merchant transaction volumes across its Clover and acquiring platforms. Additionally, the shift from cash to digital in both developed and emerging markets broadens its addressable base. 2) The company leverages this scale to cross-sell analytics, value-added services, and subscription-based solutions, strengthening recurring revenues and customer stickiness. Continued upgrades of POS systems and ISV partnerships enhance product integration and merchant reach, while the global expansion of merchant acquiring deepens geographic diversification. 3) Finally, the digital transformation of banking—through modern core platforms, open-banking APIs, and real-time payment rails—positions Fiserv as a critical enabler of next-generation financial infrastructure. From a value-investor perspective, this re-rating reflects sector de-rating (payments/fintech) and lingering execution skepticism, not fundamentals — suggesting potential re-rating upside if confidence in new management, growth and margin stability returns.

Packaging was great(not anything crazy but the standard for vinyls) and they even came early! I specifically bought them for my bf and was so excited. The description read “…with a high fidelity level of sound quality” which obviously implied that there would be very minimal to no scratchiness or other noises… right? When they arrived I noticed 2/3 of them didn’t have the paper covering that goes into the sleeve for the records. Fine ig, but when my bf played them you can hear this scratchiness in the background that just makes it seem really old. Some of these are from the 70’s so I totally get it, but why put it in the description that their sound quality was high? I was obviously a tad disappointed (and before you come for me, I have vintage vinyls my grandfather took care of since maybe the 60’s and earlier including Frank Sinatra and my grandfathers handwritten notes for the best songs to dance to on the album, so I know that it’s possible for old vinyls to sound brand new or slightly old if taken care of well enough) I would’ve only put that on there if I knew it sounded brand new. The scratchiness isn’t what bothers me, it’s the fact that the description just isn’t true… so anyways am I over reacting or is this a reasonable reaction for wanting a refund?

Here's what happened. Omitting details for privacy. 1. Ordered (buy-it-now) something for about $9 from a seller listing \"U.S. Stock\" but listing two locations - one in the U.S. and the other not. A few other sellers had the same thing for $10-$12. Shipping was indicated to be about 6 weeks, IIRC, and I concluded the seller got his stuff shipped from out of the U.S. to their U.S. location, then shipped to buyers as \"U.S. stock.\" I wasn't in a hurry, so ok. 2. After a few days I get a message from seller that they had an \"unexpected accident\" (as opposed, I guess, to an expected accident), were in the hospital, and could not ship. And would I please cancel the purchase as things would \"work better that way\" or something along those lines. I'm suspicious, but ok, whatever. 3. Ok, fine. I go through the cancellation process with Ebay. 4. Ebay comes back and says that the cancellation was refused. And now the listing for the item I had bought is showing at a higher price (around $11) plus a warning about possible import duties that wasn't in the original listing. Beginning to smell a rat here. 5. Write back to seller saying that cancellation failed and if they couldn't ship (though I'd have preferred they did ship), they should do the cancellation: either ship or refund me. 6. Seller refunds me - all but one cent. I didn't notice the missing penny at the time and concluded that was that. 7. A couple more weeks pass and I get two notices from Ebay, one saying that my order was \"with UPS\" and another saying my package would be delivered mid-November. I check out the details and notice both the missing penny and oddities in the UPS tracking: 8. UPS says the package was delivered October 9, and that tracking information was available on Oct 28 (hence the time-travel). 9. I followed the UPS tracking link and saw that a package had originated from somewhere in the U.S. (not the location originally given by the seller as theirs) and delivered Oct 9 to somewhere in my zipcode. It had a link to a photo, which showed a porch that was clearly not mine, and a package much larger than mine would have been. There's also a link to see on a map. Follow that, and it wants to send an identity-confirming code to the \"phone number associated with the sale,\" showing the first and last digits of the phone number. The number clearly isn't mine. Either a weird error or seller is really trying to pull something on someone - whether Ebay or me isn't clear, since I got my refund. 10. Ebay offered me a \"non-delivery\" report, which I used, and explained what I saw from UPS. Next day I get my missing penny refunded. Anyone seen anything like this? Could this have been some weird honest error or was this some crook trying to pull something with sub-$10 items?", "title": "Time-traveling shipment", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/1omasak/timetraveling_shipment/", "author": "Ok-Smoke-5653", "score": 0, "subreddit": "Ebay", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:14Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:14.468347"}

If you don’t feel this is fair, I’m happy to cooperate fully with any investigation or platform review.I just want to be completely honest — I genuinely believed these were authentic when I sold them. I’d never knowingly sell anything that wasn’t real or try to mislead anyone. This situation has caught me off guard, and I’m doing my best to handle it fairly and responsibly. I hope you can meet me in the middle on this so we can resolve it respectfully for both of us.Given everything, I think a 40% refund (£38) is a fair middle ground — that way, you’re compensated and can keep the AirPods. I hope that feels reasonable as I’ve tried to be transparent and meet you halfway. Me - ok, we will let ebay sought this out. It sounds a little strange, what if the box was empty and I opened it?

So when I noticed that the ’My Collection’ feature on the eBay app was free, I started fr scratch and scanning to that. I decided to scan 500 and then assess the results. I was actually pretty impressed! I loved how easy it was to sort the list by the Median Sale Price, title A-Z, or Highest/Lowest values. I got sidetracked and had to deal w/some other matters & left my scanning on hold for the time being. Well abt a month ago I had some free time & thought I’d continue w/the cards.

I recently purchased a 75 ft × 740 ft lot and I honestly have no idea what to do with it. It's in a great location - just 1 mile from the largest park in the city (over 5,000 acres), surrounded by established homes, and there are developers actively building in the area. But I have zero experience with land planning or development. **The Challenge:** The lot is long and narrow, which makes it tricky. I've been trying to visualize different possibilities - single-family home with a long driveway? Multiple structures? Barndominium? Something else? I'm completely lost. **What I Did:** Since I couldn't find a simple tool to help me visualize options, I built one. It's a free drag-and-drop canvas specifically for this 75×740 ft lot where you can place buildings, parking, roads, etc. and see real-time measurements and square footage. **Link:** https://land.brux.org **The Real Ask:** I'm not here to promote a tool - I genuinely need help figuring out what to do with this land. If you have any experience with land planning, site design, development, or even just creative ideas, I would be incredibly grateful if you could: 1. **Try designing something** on the tool and share what you come up with 2. **Tell me what's realistic** for this size and shape of lot 3. **Point out what I'm missing** or not considering 4. **Share any advice** about developing narrow lots **My Specific Questions:** - What's a realistic building footprint for 75×740 ft? - How should I handle the long driveway/access? - The bottom 240 ft is in a flood zone - how does that affect options? - Should I be thinking single structure or multiple buildings? - What's the typical setback requirements I should consider? - Is this lot even worth developing or should I sell it? **About the Location:** - 1 mile from 5,000+ acre city park - Surrounded by residential homes - Active development happening nearby - Nice neighborhood with good access - Flood zone on the back portion I made a couple example designs in the gallery, but they're probably nonsense since I don't know what I'm doing. I'm hoping people with actual experience can show me what makes sense. The tool is completely free, no sign-up required, and all designs are public.

Since the google street view from May 2018 still showed the Notice of Land Use action and the plans you could look up (L14-0002 and L14-0006). I found out that the likely reason this place never got developed is due to wetland mitigation rules in Tukwila, WA. [https://tukw-egov.aspgov.com/PZ/selectproject.html?OWASP\\_CSRFTOKEN=Q897-CU4F-KTMP-W59M-7QS7-3AR1-7KBK-E5MX](https://tukw-egov.aspgov.com/PZ/selectproject.html?OWASP_CSRFTOKEN=Q897-CU4F-KTMP-W59M-7QS7-3AR1-7KBK-E5MX) At the time, they had a 8:1 wetland mitigation rule for Class III wetlands and because developing on the parcel had a 2800 sq ft + 53 sq ft buffer unavoidable wetland impact. They needed to offset it by having, at the time, 22824 sq ft of wetland mitigation offsite. This was like 2014, and their plan expired 2018. Nowadays, they have in-lieu-fee program that lets you pay to offset it but looks like it's like $250,000 per about 1000 sq ft. And I think the mitigation to impact ratio is not as drastic, but still makes a venture with this relatively cheap parcel basically impractical, considering everyone looking at it is probably just trying to get relatively cheap land for the area. So I guess, my question finally is: how do you deal with this as a developer in WA. Are you just screwed if you got suckered into buying this land? And either have to sell the land to another sucker or cough up over a mill for wetland credits just to build and get permits. It seems pretty common for a lot of these cheap parcels have some sort of wetland mitigation caveat like streams or creeks running through them. But if you were in the shoes of the current owner (note not me, just window shopping land tbh) but was stubborn enough to want to build. How would mitigate the cost of wetland mitigation? Seems like a fools errand, but I guess one wants to dream of getting a cheap plot and actually building on it rather than waiting over half a decade for permits that end up getting denied. Idk, not happy with the choice of houses in my price range in this area of WA, so been dreaming about building. Don't really expect any gotcha answers. Just wondering what kind of response I'll get.

He said no other offers had currently been presented, but said we needed a \"strong\" offer in order to even be considered. She is encouraging me to go in at 380 or above.

My husband (30M) and I (29F) want to sell our home we bought in 2023. There are many reasons why but the main reasons are we have 2 little kids now since we’ve moved in and the house no longer fits our needs. I wish I knew this before we bought but it’s been a lesson. We’ll basically break even but also may need to bring money to the table. We’re okay with that and just really want to move. Reasons to move. It’s cheaper to rent in our area. We have a pool and I want to get rid of it with 2 babies (3yr, 6mo). We want to live in a better school district when my children start going to school. We only have $300/mo in equity per month since we had a 6% rate. I’d rather save more money towards a home we’d want to stay in for years. Property taxes are ridiculous. Want to be closer to my parents and closer to my husband’s jobs. Some reasons are more important than others but that’s the full picture. We’ve also had to put a ton of money into the house over the past year and are kind of over home ownership. (Had to replace HVAC $7k, replace the pool skimmer and mastic $5k, termites $2k, replace fans $1k). And I know if we stay, we HAVE to get a pool fence and the ones I’ve seen in my area are over $4k. We don’t want to keep investing in a home we know we don’t want to stay in. It’s a great home. Just not for us. But it feels like going backwards to my family’s house even though my parents are so kind and good with it. Has anyone done this? Or had a rent and mortgage? What happens if your home doesn’t sell?

Would a \"Sub To\" be worth considering in our situation? Or offering to give up VA entitlement to a civilian with our assumable? What else should we try? Need any and all advice, please!! My husband and I are both veterans and live in a tough rural market in South Texas. The place we are in now was a temporary arrangement we got til my husband retired from the military and we could settle down on a farmstead. In our area, it is ingrained in the culture to keep land in families, so finding acreage is near impossible or beyond what the average person can afford. We finally found something amazing, a great deal, gorgeous property, so we did a contingency offer thinking our house would sell reasonably easily. Got second opinions from other seasoned agents. They all thought our place was a catch. Well, it didn't. So, we went ahead and used my VA entitlement and bought the farm anyway without having our house sold. We are faithful savers and have near perfect credit + an amazing, sympathetic lender which is what allowed us to make this happen. We just closed on the farm yesterday, so we need an alternative plan to get out from under our current place. All feedback received from showings has been nothing but positive. Beautiful home, great price, full of character and charm and bla bla bla. But no offers. No houses in our area are moving. We are in a very desirable school district and safe area. When we moved here, you couldn't even find a place to live because everyone wanted to live here because of the schools and community. Now, even that isn't attracting people. We are fully aware we assumed this risk when we purchased without having sold and it is 100% our issue to contend with. But, the risk was worth it because we have been looking fervently for a property for 3.5 years, so when this opportunity presented itself, we pounced. Every local seasoned agent said our house would sell so fast, so that was also a reason we pounced with such vigor. But, at this point, we are needing an alternative plan because sustaining two mortgages is not fun. We manage the two hence being approved for a second one and we have savings as back up support, but it is not fun. Renting is also an idea, but we realllllllllllllllllllly don't want to be landlords unless we absolutely have to. And even then, local rentals have been sitting. We also have been marketing it as a VA assumable to fellow veterans with NO gap. We have lowered and lowered until it is break even at this point. We are open to taking a loss, but just don't know what to do. Our agent has been hustling trying everything, but still crickets. She has lowered her commission to try to allow us to price lower, but still, nothin. It's not just our house, it's everywhere around here.

This was during the financial crisis in 09. We had good credit, but nobody was lending. This relative took out a loan for the price of the home, but after 2 years, paid it off. We do have an agreement, drawn up by the relative's lawyer, that we are to pay a certain amount each month until the loan is paid off. The relative is listed on our home owner's insurance policy as the mortgagee. However, now we are in a position where we want to do some extensive home repair (new roof, exterior paint, windows, etc). We don't really want to take out a home improvement loan - we'd rather do a cash out refinance or HELOC for a lower rate. Are either of those even possible in this situation? I'm wondering how lenders treat these types of mortgages, or whether they are even considered mortgages at all?", "title": "Is a mortgage financed by an individual considered a real mortgage?", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/housing/comments/5t3cpy/is_a_mortgage_financed_by_an_individual/", "author": "sixwoolsocks", "score": 1, "subreddit": "housing", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:14Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:14.013493"}

Found out that two roommates are planning to screw the rest of us over big time So this year me, Kate (using fake names cause I really don't want them to figure out that we know what they're planning), and another girl, Isabelle, signed a 12-month lease on a 4 bedroom house with a couple, Becca and Jack, who didn't initially want to be on the lease. All our names ended up being on the lease because we had to negotiate to have Beccas two cats and Jacks dog on the lease and ended up paying $20 more a week in pet rent. Becca lived in a different town and didn't move in until 2 weeks after the rest of us, so she wasn't there during the property viewing however Jack claimed the largest room in the property for her as it was separated from the house by a sunroom and laundry so she could bring her cats in with her. This room is also an add-on to the house and has wood floors, it's own tv and internet ports, and is in general a much nicer room than the 70's era main house. Jack also agreed that because Beccas room was quite literally twice the size of the smallest room in the property, Isabelles room, Becca would pay $20 a week more rent and Isabelle would pay $20 a week less rent. Isabelles room is only about 3 metres square (about 10 feet square) and she can only just fit her bed, wardrobe and a bedside table in. This rent split was verbally agreed on during the inspection and also afterwards in a Facebook message chain. Immediately after Becca moves in, she and Jack become hostile and begin to bully Isabelle, who is very non-confrontational. They pay the agreed split of rent ($80 for me, $80Jack, $60 for Isabelle, and $100 for Becca) for the first 4 weeks then decided that they wouldn't be paying it any longer and bullied Isabelle into agreeing to everyone paying $80 a week, in the process making her cry and the both of us feel so unsafe in our own home that we installed locks on our room doors (with written permission from the landlord). My room is right next to the bathroom and sound carries through the walls. Becca and Jack shower together and I guess they thought the shower would cover their conversation because they discussed moving to a new town in July. I talked to Isabelle about it and she'd been told by Jack that he and Becca were considering moving in July and he'd asked if he could get his share of the bond back. When she asked him if he was going to find new roommates he replied \"I'll post it on bss (buy/swap/sell Facebook group) but it doesn't matter\". Isabelle and I are both students and we can't cover the rent by ourselves. What are our options if these two just leave six months before the lease is up?

This is where the trouble starts he finds out that the gas for our apartment hasn't been paid for 7 months and begins to blame us. Eventually he offers to pay 25% of the bill which he claims he doesn't know that balance of if we agree to pay the other 75% and put one of our names on the account, and again he claims that he can't access the account in order to figure out the balance yet he's the one that set it up in the first place, not to mention the fact that while on the phone with me told me that it makes sense that there's a 7 month gas bill because something has affected his credit and he lets me know that the gas bill has gone into collections. Essentially we are legally responsible for hot water but not (according to the lease) responsible for what he calls \"cooking gas\". Gas fuels the water heater however cooking gas is not a necessity, the option to have cooking gas is dependent upon the tenant's discretion to use the stove to COOK (IF it is a gas powered range).. If we had known (or HE had known) that the water heater was gas powdered surely we would have initiated an account prior to moving in. Yes he has agreed to cover a portion of it but are we on the hook for the total bill? He claims its not his responsibility and that we chose to ignore the welcome letter and \"here we are\" with no hot water I would just like advice on this situation although I have already spoken to an attorney and filed a HPD complaint for lack of hot water here in Brooklyn", "title": "Landlord won't pay gas bill, hot water not working", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/housing/comments/5npkn6/landlord_wont_pay_gas_bill_hot_water_not_working/", "author": "Jahmal482", "score": 1, "subreddit": "housing", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:13Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:13.985054"}

I have lived in this building for a year and a few months, and our next door neighbor told my guests as they were leaving that they are going to call the police on us due to the sound. Now, as far as I’m aware, they have not left a note, brought this to our attention, or even reported us to the complex for noise. Granted, it was around 11 pm-1 am, but it was a Saturday night. No one was yelling or slamming into anything and if I am being honest, some of my friends do get loud when we have them over on weekdays. This was not the case for that night. I know you can hear what’s going on through the front door if you are standing outside, but in the other rooms it’s quiet. I guess I am wondering these things: Should I alert the complex about the threat? or, should I confront the neighbor about them approaching people that do not live here instead of confronting me and the other occupant in the apartment? If I am being honest, I would love to match their energy and bring up the daily loud noises from all around us that also last until 1 in the morning! I believe if they would have just spoken to me, the other occupant, or left a note, I would have done all I could to prevent this from happening. I’ve lived in complexes where someone’s been shot, domestic violence, loud parties until 6 AM, things of that nature. I would like to be a good neighbor obviously, but immediately calling the police?

I recently moved to eastern Tennessee in late July, and my apartment has had a consistent roach problem. I do want to preface these aren’t German roaches, they’re the so called “palmetto bugs” aka Smokey brown roaches. I’m told they are common outside bugs and generally do not infest. Unfortunately, I would say my apartment is on par with infestation for the palmetto bugs. When I first moved in, I saw probably 2-3 cockroach nymphs a day. I let management know and they said I’d get put on the pest control list and they gave me some credit off next months rent. September was pretty good, I didn’t see nymphs as often. Now it’s November and getting cold, and I see no nymphs, but I have had the big adult cockroach’s in my room about everyday. It’s taking a toll on my mental health and sleep, I had my first ever migraine the other day because I now sleep with the light on and stress wake up multiple times through the night. I’m wondering if anyone else has dealt with this and was able to break their lease? I’ll still have to check what my lease says about early termination, but I feel like this is enough cause to hopefully no need to buy out the remainder of my lease. I’m just really frustrated, no one else I know living in apartments is dealing with this issue, and I’m at my wits end. I think it has a lot to do with poor sealing in the apartment and where my unit is located (it’s also just a shit apartment, unfortunately I wasn’t able to see it before leasing as I was moving from the Midwest), so I don’t think any amount of pest control can fix this issue.

I’ve never had the experience of having issues in a rental right off the bat and I’ve actually never had to make maintenance requests in previous rentals, even in a rental I lived in for 6 years. I’ve also never rented from a property management group and this one has a bad reputation. When I first moved in, I listed a lot of issues on the checklist I was given but I didn’t even get all of them. Maintenance fixed the big ones, including a major leak, but not everything I reported. I’ve now discovered even more things like a tear in the carpet, a crack in the linoleum, bad caulking, peeling doors/cabinets/drawers, etc. Everything I see on Reddit says to make a maintenance request for the issues so I’m not blamed for them. But I’ve also heard that property management companies don’t like to receive a ton of maintenance requests as it costs them money. I’ve even heard of them not renewing leases for this reason, which I’m afraid of as I want to stay despite the issues. I had planned to be the most undemanding tenant I could be for that reason. If I don’t report things soon(I’ve been here ~6 months), will I just be blamed for it all?

What can I do? I live in a trailer but I rent, we moved in April of this year and about 3 months ago (June/July) I started having issues with my sink. I first noticed my dishwasher would drain into the sink before going down. I ended up having the sink back up underneath my cupboards from a part of the sink I’m not familiar with. Maintenance came and replaced a leaky “cap” piece and when he ran water he asked if my sink was always draining slow. I hadn’t had that issue yet but he loosened the cap and said it was better. My sink consistently drained slower after that. I’d hit it with the plunger every once in a while and it would go down. That stopped working a few weeks ago and my sinks were backed up entirely. Maintenance came back when I called and said they couldn’t see a clog and they’d have to call a plumber. The plumber told me they had been there for the same issue with the previous tenant but had issues with being able to communicate with them (language barrier).

I moved into an apartment in July that is owned by a highly regarded property company in my city. Their other properties were way out of my price range, so I picked the oldest/cheapest one (built in 1981). Its $1314 a month, which is like 46% of my income, but every other complex in my price range had hundreds of reviews about roach infestations, black mold, break ins, etc. I moved in and my first week discovered a german roach. I told them and they said theyd put me on the list for pest control. I also saw fleas and carpet beetles, to which they said \"that picture doesnt look like a carpet beetle, more like a pantry or cigarette beetle\" (it didnt). They never acknowledged the fleas. The pest control guy saw that i bought Alpine WSG and said \"do you even want me to spray, that stuffs better than what i got\". The next visit he said \"you're not seeing any roaches, you just need to smoke a joint\" despite the pictures i had. I also had issues with the AC/closet smelling like mold (btw the ac closet had a box of open baking soda in there that was crystallized, a plunger, cardboard from a package, and some other trash from before i moved in). maintenance said \"i dont smell anything\" and sprayed bleach on the evap coils. I was also told that if i mention mold, i have 3 days to vacate. But they didnt say for how long, or mention any accommodations. I reached out to corporate since the office was ignoring all of these issues, and they wrote back saying they called the property manager, who said i never followed up about the issues and thats why they didnt fix them. I was livid. Eventually property manager replaced the ac unit which was nice. The ac techs who replaced it said it was long overdue. Im still dealing with the roaches, theres dead skin in all the light switches and gunk in the outlets (im gonna buy toothpicks to scrape it out), the oven and counters had crumbs on them when i moved in, the kitchen and bathroom cabinets have never been replaced and have a smell i cant get out of them, and i could go on. I also noticed like gunk growing in my shower, along with a gross funky smell (i think its mold but im not sure). I tried everything i could (bleach, vinegar, boiling water, drano, scrubbing) and the smell has not gone away. My exhaust fan has to run for 3 hrs to get rid of the humidity, and it rattles really loudly (my parents said it does that when its about to die). Today i told them about the smell and the fan, to which the maintenance man said \"all the fans here rattle, its a feature\" and laughed. I asked if he could smell the funky sock smell right when he walked in, and he said \"i smell bleach but thats it\" and then he left! I had bleached the night before, but could still smell the dirty sock smell clear as day. Another resident had very similar issues, posted a 1 star google review with pictures, and the maintenance man threatened them to take it down Im just frustrated and cant believe i have 9 months left of this.

We’ve lived in the same apartment for almost 10 years. About 3 years ago, our neighbors had their first kid and things were fine, relatively quiet. But about a year and a half ago, they had their second, and since then the screaming has been nonstop. Not fun, playful screaming, but full-on “being-boiled-alive” screaming, every single day. We checked in with the parents a while back just to make sure everything was okay. They said, “Oh, they’re just in that phase of learning vocabulary. Thanks for your patience.” That was in May. It’s now November, and nothing has changed except that our patience is wearing thin. We’ve talked with the other neighbors in the building and everyone from the 1st to the 5th floor can hear it, even when we’re on the roof we can hear it. We’re the only ones sharing a wall, so we get the brunt of it. Other tenants have mentioned looking for new places and have contacted the landlord too. I reached out to the landlord, and he seems sympathetic but unsure what to do since “it’s a kid” and “they’re not doing it on purpose.” Fair enough. The parents are genuinely nice people, but aside from our one conversation, there’s been zero acknowledgment of how bad it’s gotten. We’ve done what we can: moved furniture, lined our shared wall with closets full of clothes, even tried noise-cancelling headphones. Still no luck. It’s a converted loft, so the walls are thin, but this level of noise just wasn’t an issue before. We’ve thought about moving, but it’s a great apartment: rent controlled, good landlord. Everything was perfect until the second kid arrived. And now the older one’s figured out that screaming gets attention, so they’re both at it. At this point, I’m just looking for any ideas to suggest to the landlord. Would soundproofing their unit be a reasonable ask? Any other creative fixes? We’re running out of ideas short of a full renovation. Thankfully we’re only here part of the year, but it would be nice to not feel driven out by the noise when there are probably solutions!

Yes I intervene. The ruckus you are hearing at 4pm? That's my older daughter, melting down because I won't make Dino nuggies for dinner. She's got a shit ton of homework I have to help her with, but she's completely disordered because she's so picky she's refused the (free) breakfast and lunch at her school.

To preface, I would like to note that in my current apartment we live on the top floor and it’s just me (24F) and my boyfriend (24M) and our small two pound kitten. A few days ago we got a note on our door from our downstairs neighbor, it stated that she’s having a hard time relaxing on the weekend because of the constant “stomping” and during the weekdays she is waking up between the hours of 5-7 AM due to more “stomping”. She did also state that she knows she can’t control what we do in our apartment, but is asking us to be mindful of our movements. I initially felt bad, because this is the first time we’re both living in an apartment without another unit on top of us. We’ve all experienced a noisy upstairs neighbor, and maybe we thought it was on purpose or just normal human life! I drafted a letter in response to hers, and I stated that we apologize for the inconvenient noise. I also put in the letter that we both get up M-Th around 4:45-7 AM to go to work. And since we got our kitten we often have to chase her out of the living room. I also put in the letter that this is kinda just apartment life, and that you’ll hear things that you don’t want to hear sometimes and it can be inconvenient. And ever since we got our kitten two weeks ago, we’ve been sticking to our room and bathroom (they connect) so our kitten doesn’t get into a whole mess in the living room/kitchen area. I also put in the letter that prior to moving to the top floor we lived on the second floor, and could clearly hear conversations, vacuuming, babies crying and music. (We moved apartments due to mold). But we never complained to the other people about noise, because we knew we are community living. I texted my mom and sisters about this letter and they all advised I don’t send it to her, as they think this will open a door for communication and an expectation of silence from us. So we didn’t send it and i’m holding onto the letter in case she sends another one. Flash forward to today, my boyfriend got out of bed and opened the door to our living area and our kitten escaped so he had to go get her. As soon as he walked inside of our room with our kitten (literally 15 seconds) she starts banging on her ceiling. Now, this is not the first time we’ve heard banging on our ceiling, and we brushed it aside before but after receiving her letter we quickly put it together that she is the one doing it. I am now annoyed because it seems like every time we walk around our apartment it’s followed by banging on her ceiling. What do you think we should do in the scenario? We don’t want her to be inconvenienced by our movements, but we’re also not deliberately making noise. We are quieter people, and we’re not heavyset. I would like to note that we do live in a “luxury” apartment and pay a stupid amount of money for rent. Our lease ends in the spring and we’re not planning on resigning, and in her letter she stated that she moved in a couple of weeks ago. But we dealt with a serious mold problem in our last unit (same building) and now enjoy our current apartment mold free! But now we’re stumped on what to do, as we can’t promise that we aren’t going to be “noisy” as it’s just us doing mundane things.

Our downstairs neighbors are indoor and outdoor smokers. It’s super annoying because our apartment has started to smell like cigarettes and weed when we don’t smoke. We originally thought our building was smoking free but when we complained they sent out a memo saying it actually doesn’t violate the lease and is allowed. So our neighbors have been really at smoking indoors despite us leaving them a note politely asking them to smoke outside since their smoke affects us. Is there anything that we can do? I’ve tried candles, covering vents with dryer sheets, asking maintenance to replace the air filter, etc. we can’t open our windows often because again they smoke outdoors too so we just get outdoor cigarette smell when trying to air out. We can’t have candles on or plug in wall scents because we have pets and those are toxic to them. We spray disinfectant and air freshener spray regularly but whenever they are smoking the smell comes back. Which is all the fucking time. Please SOS is there anything we can say to property management, township, neighbors, etc to get them to stop smoking indoors? Or at least is there anything we can do for venting the apartment when they smoke multiple times a day? I already have issues with health that I feel the smoke exacerbates (random wheezing but it isn’t asthma), and I don’t want to have health issues from second hand cigarette smoke exposure.

{"id": "1olok2b", "created_at": "2025-11-01T14:00:36Z", "text": "How do you handle noisy neighbours when it involves a child? (England) Hi all, It seems this sub is quite US focused but maybe you guys could still have some suggestions or advice, or be able to offer just a bit of comfort. Myself and my partner have been having an incredibly difficult month or so with noise from our upstairs neighbours. We're first time buyers and have been in our flat since around February this year, the tenant above is a lady and her young daughter, maybe around two. They are in a housing association property, managed by the same one as ours. I'm not overly familiar with the ins and outs of how it works when someone is placed in HA property, but my understanding is that its a home that is owned and managed by the HA, providing affordable housing. This same HA manages our property which we purchased via a mortgage. The tenant doesn't seem to work, so it could be likely that the cost is covered by government benefits. I'm not sure of the details or how it works but trying to give some context to anyone who may have not heard the term before. For most of the time we've been here we've had no issues, to be fair they've always been fairly noisy, she would often blast loud music and the kid would run around a bit, but we've been incredibly laid back, definitely more so than many would be. It was still home and we were comfortable. Since around a month ago a man started to frequently be at the property, he is extremely loud and they would have huge shouting arguments almost daily. He left for a few days after an argument and things settled somewhat, but then he returned. For maybe a week things felt a bit more settled and normal, despite him being around. I started to relax a bit more and settled into a new normal for our home I guess. Over the past week or so things have deteriorated, the little girl is acting up a lot, maybe due to changing household dynamics, or just a coincidence as toddlers go through stages. It has been incredibly disruptive, loud impact noises all through the day from her running around, peaking at 7 to 9pm where she runs around the entire flat, the noise and vibrations are horrendous to deal with and I hate being here at the moment. Most days I'm woken up, I'm often up early for work, but on weekends it feels especially hard. I knocked on the door the other night and asked if they can try and keep it down. The lady looked frazzled and said she can't do anything about it, but then went back up and it was silent the rest of the night. The next day I went to the office and the evening was fairly settled, but the pattern has continued, it feels like constant banging above my head all day making it hard to work or relax and the evenings are awful. They have been keeping their voices down somewhat, I feel less like they're in the room. I actively avoid being here as much as possible, my partner deals with it better but I can tell he is upset too. I'm lucky to have him as a calming presence, as I dont know how someone on their own would be coping. I feel like I've done all I can by politely mentioning it so they know there's an issue. We have been keeping noise logs and recordings too. Yesterday I've reached out to the housing association asking for some guidance. It feel like a really delicate situation and I want to handle it sensitively. It all feels really sad currently and we're locked in to the mortgage for 3 years so its been rough. They seems to always be there so it's hard to catch a break. I'm hoping the housing association can help as they probably deal with issues like this a lot, I was just wondering if anyone has any experience with a similar situation. I brought a white noise machine that helps ever so slightly, but I'm feeling frazzled, it's not really feeling like home right now so I don't have a place I can feel comfortable. I can imagine this is a situation that many deal with but it still feels quite isolating and maybe the most stressful thing I've ever dealt with. Do you think I've taken the right steps so far? I've stressed that I'm just looking for some guidance from the HA and would like to keep the tenants out of it for now if possible while we talk.", "title": "How do you handle noisy neighbours when it involves a child?

I picked the specific apartment I’m in because it had a lot of natural light in the mornings. Things have been fine for months except for occasionally the tennis court lights would be on pretty late at night which completely illuminated my apartment but it happened pretty rarely. About a month ago, the lights came on more often, sometimes staying on all night. I have blackout curtains in my bedroom and they were no match for these lights. To make matters worse, one of the lights seems broken and it strobes on and off constantly. So I emailed the office and they said they would look into it. Nothing happened and I emailed again and they said they were short staffed with maintenance but would look into it. Finally after about two weeks of this, the lights appeared to have been put on a timer—they come on at 6pm and turn off at 10pm. I get up at 5am for work and I go to bed pretty early so 10pm was still bothering me, not to mention the strobe light. They said they have someone come look at the broken light and start turning the lights off at 9pm. I have all my windows covered with sheets and blankets. I’m not buying anymore sheets to deal with this. It’s hard to even watch tv in the evenings because of this strobe light flashing across the wall my tv is on. This never happened for months and months and now all the sudden it’s every night. I wouldn’t have rented here if I knew this was the case. I looked up county codes for light ordinances and there’s something that addresses it but it’s worded for lights from signs. I can still try to file a complaint. Is there anything else I should do? I don’t want to pay to break my lease for something like this, but I’m miserable. I can’t use my patio in the evenings at all now, my apartment looks crazy with all these sheets and blankets draped everywhere, I get no morning light now because everything is covered up, and I haven’t slept well in weeks.

I have a cat and a rat, and no where to go, I'm panicking. I texted my landlord letting her know I can pay what I have (300$ ish) and by Monday I'll try to figure out something else.

Because if so, Imma just go get a tent, find somewhere decent, and use my money for weed and food because this isn't worth it anymore and I'm ready to just give up. I'm done being poor.

I have a relative who belongs to one of these - there’s even a super cheap pharmacy attached to the practice. And the doctor has privileges at the local hospital. Your local health department may offer more services than you realize. And finally - all health care pricing is negotiated. Insurance just does the negotiating for their subscribers.

I’ve been on medical leave for a long time because of severe depression, anxiety, chronic insomnia, ED and BPD (All of this diagnosed at 14yo, BPD two years ago). I’m under public healthcare, but the waiting lists in Spain are months long. I haven’t seen my doctor since June to beg her for help since i was at my very limit and told me i had to wait, it’s been 4 months now, i also had to stop private therapy the beginning of this year because I can’t afford it anymore. Last time i saw my psychiatrist he diagnosed me with PTSD which kind of makes sense but with all the mix i already have it feels like im collecting them like pokemon cards. It shattered me more than i already was. I’m 30yo right now, ive been in a really really bad and rough place and even tho i try every single time to stand up and continue with my life its harder each day, i well i can say im tired of trying anymore, i think my existence is done already and thats okay, yes i had a lot of “professionals” who were honestly not good. I know this is just a short resume of all the things that are going on and how i feel but i dont feel safe and im scared to being this vulnerable and open about it, i dont have a family at all neither they help me and yes they know about everything, i lost my group of friends last year so im basically alone and this loneliness is killing me, it hurts so much i dont even know how to express it. Right now, I’m struggling with everything, to afford groceries and therapy sessions that would help me stay stable. I’m doing everything I can to hold on, but it’s getting harder, since i’m on a medical leave for two years already my job suspended my contract, but i can’t work either and i depend on the little percentage my mutua gives me. I live alone and i have cats that are the only ones tying me here on earth, it’s going off so bad that i can’t function as a proper human and that makes me go down the hole, i try, i promise i try everyday. I started to also feel very sick since march i did some medial tests and because im not eating i have now a lot of deficiencies, sometimes im just hungry, i just want to eat other than bread and jam with water, i pay every bill and all my responsibilities all for my cats since they don’t deserve to feel in any sense that because of my situation or poorest decisions, they have to eat and have a good care before me, they’re not at fault i’m a bad owner and im so sorry for them too, i’m not looking for pity, just some guidance or support or even someone just to listen to me.

There's an amazing community program in the town that I live in. They attempt to feed everyone that they're able to, and the program also supports tutoring, youth mentorship, elderly support, and summer camps for kids. We had a pay bonus this week, and based on advice I've seen here, I called the program coordinator to ask what the needs are. They weren't asking for cash donations. They were asking that whoever could afford it to please go to the local grocery and take advantage of the chicken sale and donate the meat. This program has several freezers where they can store donated meat and other foods. The local grocery was selling chicken at $.79 per pound. That's the absolute minimum price that I've seen chicken selling at on recent years. The limit for purchase was 5 packages per person per week. That's a lot of chicken, especially when the grocery package of chicken is an average of 3 pounds per package! Between friends and family, we managed to donate almost 100 pounds of meat as well as feed ourselves. I know that the community around me did so much more. Example from my community program: A person in my community who needs the food bank brought some chicken to donate while they picked up shelf stable food that they didn't have money to buy. They receive help every week, but they can't use $5 of sale chicken before it will go bad, and they can't store it for her future use either. They donated $5, and left with much more than that. I had absolutely no idea that the people in my community who NEED this food bank also essentially \"trade\" food for food. Sometimes cash isn't the king, so please call your local program and ask how much you can help them stretch a dollar. If I hadn't called, I honestly wouldn't have known how much my 5 dollars could do for someone else. 5 dollars is not a lot for folks who can spare it, but for my community food program, 5 dollars in donated chicken meat will feed 5 families. My community program is amazing. I can't believe how many people they feed when money is so scarce. They review all the local grocery sales and work with the sales to fill the food pantry shelves. I was also informed that there is a need for winter gloves and hats and mittens, as I'm in a cold climate. I don't have those things to donate, but I do have fiber arts skill, and another community program gave me yarn to make into hats and mittens. It's not much, but it's what my Memere taught me to do and share with others, so I will. Sometimes cash is needed, sometimes time is needed. Sometimes specific food on sale is needed!

I've been messing around with n8n for like 3-4 months now, mostly just building random shit for myself because I'm a nerd and it's fun. Last month I'm sitting in Starbucks (yeah yeah I know) trying to look productive, and this real estate lady next to me is VENTING to her friend about how she keeps missing leads. Like she's legitimately stressed about it. Something about Zillow inquiries coming in at weird hours and by the time she sees them the next day, people have already connected with other agents. Now normally I mind my own business but I'd literally just watched a tutorial on webhook automations the night before so I'm like... I could fix that? So I do the awkward lean-over thing and I'm like \"sorry I couldn't help overhearing but I actually build automation stuff, I might be able to help?\" She looked at me like I was trying to sell her a timeshare lmao but she gave me her business card anyway. What I actually built her: Basic webhook setup to catch form submissions from her website. Auto-reply email that goes out in like a minute saying \"thanks I got your message, I'll hit you back soon\". Everything dumps into a Google Sheet so she can see all her leads in one place. Her phone gets an SMS whenever a new lead comes in (she LOVED this part). If she doesn't check off that she contacted them within 24hrs, they get an automatic follow-up. Honest to god it took me maybe 6 hours? And half of that was me googling \"how to format SMS in n8n\" and troubleshooting why the webhook kept timing out , seems i had wrong webhook. I charged her $450 because I literally had no idea what to charge and that felt like a big number but not TOO big ya know? Plot twist: Two weeks later she calls me HYPED. Apparently a lead came through at like 11pm on a Saturday night - she was already in bed but got the text, sent a quick reply from her phone, and ended up closing the deal. The commission? Twelve. Thousand. Dollars. She literally said \"you just paid for yourself like 25 times over\" and then referred me to two other agents in her office. If you're thinking about doing this: Dude just start.

(marketing question) hey everyone, freelance web dev here I'm 23 and I run my own web dev agency I do make decent money but I'm extremely afraid my source of leads will run dry eventually, I did some research and I have a few specific and general question. 1-how can I effectively market my services and get leads? Freelance websites like Freelancer and UpWork are too competitive and unrealistic to work on today, cold outreach in a lot of cases does annoy people rather than get a lead, what's the most effective way someone like me can get leads? 2-where can I find marketing agencies that can use my services for their clients? from the research I did it seems that the best approach is to partner with a marketing agency and offer my services for them in exchange for a cut of what I charge or they can just white label my services and charge what they want. 3- should I bother with cold outreach? I just have no idea if I should even consider it or not, should I just search for contact info for business that have shitty or no websites and contact them and offer something?

It started 7 years ago when I began the journey to fix the RV industry with an app meant to connect RVers with technicians. It took me 4 years to build and it made a total of $4. I made an AMA about it, and it blew up, even getting posted about by some famous tech guys. It was exciting and embarrassing, but it put me on the path to create my next project. My next project, which I built and released a year and a half ago (this one only took me 1 year to build, as I had learned that 4 years was too long to actually say out loud). I finally tasted the sweet taste of victory when I had made my first $50 sale. Unbeknownst to me, this project would actually become a hit in the industry... amongst 7 users. Still.. this platform today generates $350/month for me and it's pretty much entirely passive at this point. Again, this was an app for the RV industry; a high quality RV inspection platform. Even after countless hours spent marketing, cold emailing, designing and redesigning ads, I found it almost impossible to even receive a \"fuck off\" in my inbox. This lead me to pivot entirely away from the RV industry as they clearly were not ready for my immense skill in software building. My next software is something I've wanted to build for as long as I could remember. A service business management platform. I'm now 10 months into my journey of building, and expect to be finished by the year end (even though I've been telling my wife, \"I'm finally almost finished!\" by month 6). This is my most polished, most comprehensive, and the most commited to a project I've been since I released an android game 13 years ago that ended up making $20k in a few months before falling off the world. I've learned a lot of marketing skills with my last project that I plan to apply to this one. The most important is that I'm capable of marketing my product for at least 3 months without getting any traction/sales as I've done that before. And I also know that if I do get 1 sale, that is enough validation for me to keep me going for another 3 months. However, if anyone has any suggestion as far as not taking 3 months to get 1 user goes, I'm open to it! Anyway, sorry for the dump. I just felt like writing a little bit before bed and hope this can entertain, motivate, or otherwise inspire some sort of feelings of something in someone else out there.

I started when I was 14, just looking for any way to earn online. I tried CPA, affiliate marketing, freelancing you name it. None of it clicked for me. The only things that brought in a little cash were surveys and game offers, and even then, the pay wasn’t great. I’ve been jumping from one thing to another, just hoping to find something that actually works for me. I really don’t have the time or energy to throw into something that eats up my whole day. Things are rough, I can barely afford food or basics. No matter how hard I try, I keep hitting dead ends. I even decided to focus on something I actually care about, just to see if it felt better. So, I built a Chrome extension that helps people where their researches. A few people used it, it even got featured , but honestly, it didn’t go anywhere. I’m not expecting to blow up with thousands of users, but it’s tough not to feel like I wasted all that time. It took me 4-5 months to finish that extension while seeking help on Discord Servers. I feel like a failure sometimes, especially when I look at how much time I’ve put in for almost nothing. I can’t even cover my basic needs, and finding a job feels impossible and I've applied to over a hundred jobs and nothing’s landed. I’m not asking to get rich, just want to be able to handle my own stuff without stressing about every little thing. I’m actually pretty good at computer repairs, so I tried offering my services on platforms like Fiverr, but my gig barely got any attention. Then I switched to cryp-to, and wow, so many scammers out there just trying to take your money with zero intention of helping. Funny enough, the only thing that made me any real money was gambling. I made about a hundred bucks, but I had to quit before it I become addicted. Seriously, don’t mess with gambling, so it’s not worth it. Some nights I can’t even sleep because my mind just keeps running in circles about all this stuff. I’m burned out, anxious, and it feels like I’m never going to hit my goal. I can accept failures, but I just need to find something sustainable that I can visualize it in a way that will be guaranteed. Sorry for the long rant.

How easy everything would be with AI, how our phones prevent us from doing great things. Since my sole purpose is to persuade people via email to become a client, I also had AI generate some texts for me. It could never be as good as real, handwritten words. The problem lies in the punctuation, the lack of pauses, and the absence of vagueness, which is replaced by structure and clarity. What I mean by this is: None of us think in these structures, and seeing them, especially when expecting a genuine message, is met with rejection. For all of us. If we're looking for something concrete, bullet points suffice, but to build a relationship, it's not enough. It doesn't reflect how we think, how we feel. A rollercoaster of positive and negative emotions. So instead of listening to any signals, searching for unnecessary, overly detailed details to use as \"icebreakers,\" I focused on the essentials. I work with several agencies, and my goal was to find design clients for restaurants in Belgium and convert them into customers. My words, therefore, have the potential to bring about a change in a person's current state, if successful. It could be the brooding over a better website, the fear of losing customers due to a new restaurant on the street, or simply the desire to be seen. These people sit in their offices, pondering these things, and I had to catch them at that moment. I had to capture that feeling. So I started writing down this situation. I looked for busy streets in large Belgian cities and small towns with little activity. I looked at established restaurants on the street and the newest ones.

Our core constraint: **Zero initial capital.** We must operate on 100% self-sustained revenue from Day 1, having cut the planned significant initial capital. We've designed a revenue-funded scaling model where every expense is covered by immediate customer revenue. **Where does this plan fail?** I need your most brutal, step-by-step critique of the major points of failure (PoF) in this highly constrained model. To survive Year 1, we aggressively cut fixed costs. Our plan: * **HR/OPEX Reduction:** We reduced the projected expense base by over 70%, aiming for only a minimal annual operational cost. This relies heavily on founders doing \"sweat equity\" and delaying all major salaried hires. * **Financial Mandate:** We *must* achieve a positive Profit After Tax (PAT) in Year 1 (projecting immediate profitability) to avoid failure. This requires immediate, effective monetization from affordable subscriptions and high-margin microtransactions. **PoF #1: The Cash Runway.** Is it fundamentally unrealistic to generate enough subscription/microtransaction revenue in a brand-new dating app in its first 12 months to cover **all** operational costs without *any* cash buffer? What is the most likely expense category (e.g., unexpected Cloud fees, Payment Gateway charges, or Legal costs) to break this minimal budget? We eliminated the projected massive technology budget by using a minimal viable product (MVP) approach based entirely on free/freemium tools. * **MVP Stack:** Frontend built on no-code/low-code platforms, backend/DB on free-tier cloud services, and free analytics tools. * **Scaling Trigger:** We will only upgrade to a scalable, dedicated paid infrastructure (e.g., a dedicated cloud backend) when accumulated revenue and user count (e.g., 5,000 active users) justifies the expenditure. **PoF #2: Technical Debt and Migration Risk.** When we hit 5,000 users, is it feasible to successfully migrate the entire database, user data, and real-time chat infrastructure from a no-code/free-tier stack to a paid, dedicated framework *without* a massive, destabilizing loss of user experience or sudden, overwhelming infrastructure costs that kill our cash flow? We eliminated the large marketing budget, relying exclusively on Product-Led Growth (PLG) and Net Revenue Retention (NRR). * **Viral Loop:** We incentivize sharing by using non-monetary, two-sided rewards, like giving both the referrer and the referee free in-app credits or temporary Premium access. This aims to convert the friction of the anonymous chat feature (low match rates) into a viral incentive. * **NRR Mandate:** We require NRR (Net Revenue Retention) to be >110% to fund all subsequent development phases. **PoF #3: The Viral Plateau.** Are non-monetary incentives powerful enough to sustain the viral loops needed to go from 10k users (Year 1) to 1 million users (Year 5)? Does the non-monetary reward structure inherently attract lower-intent users who will churn quickly, destroying the required >110% NRR target? As an intermediary in India, we must comply with strict Indian intermediary and data protection regulations. * **Compliance Risk:** We are deferring the hiring of a full-time Compliance Officer until Year 3. Until then, a founder acts as the Grievance Officer, managing compliance with only a minimal legal retainer. * **Content Moderation:** We rely on basic open-source Natural Language Processing (NLP) and trial automated tools to automatically flag obscene content, minimizing human moderation costs. **PoF #4: Regulatory/Legal Black Swan.** If we face a major data breach or a serious legal complaint (e.g., obscenity violation) in Year 1 or 2, will the minimal legal structure and reliance on automated moderation be enough to secure the legal \"safe harbor\" protection, or will a single regulatory failure bankrupt the company before Year 3? *Please tear this plan apart.

And I wanted to get a wider sense from the community by posing the title question. I have a startup with pre-seed (\\~750k USD) investment, with 3 VCs + an angel on the cap-table.

We have to give them monthly updates and they have observer status at our board meetings. They try to be helpful with connecting us with their network or giving advice. But they are not pushy or demanding. They do not try and tell us how to run our business. And it's not like it's been smooth sailing for our business. I consider this to be normal for a few reasons: (1) they know +90% of their investments will go to zero and are comfortable with the risk, (2) the people we're seeing have skin in the game, but it's not life or death for them and (3) VCs long ago realised that you get worse outcomes by becoming over-involved in a portfolio company. But I've seen some people in this sub claiming their VC investors caused them to burn-out and that VCs should provide more mental health care, etc etc. TBH - I've seen/heard about that kind of behaviour more from \"angel\" investors than VC. So I am trying to get a sense of what's \"normal\". Tell me your experience! And, it would really help if you could say when and where (country/region) you raised money, how much and what round.

Is this right? I call it Boost-strapping. It's like having a jetpack attached to you and your business and hiding it. Personally, I think it is dishonest to claim your company was bootstrapped if you utilized any type of outside funding besides personal funds, family, friends, or maybe personal loans. Even personal loans can be up for debate...

I know gtm and growth is such a tough task, so hopefully some practical advice will help.* A few years ago, my friend started a growth role at a meal subscription startup for microwavable meals. They just raised a big Seed Round and came to me asking about paid media --- how I'd built to 3K subs and how to deal with iOS updates killing their targeting. Facebook ads weren't working and they were saying it felt really unfair. So I asked them what was their target CAC? The founders would be happy with 2-month payback, about £80-100. Whoaaaaa, I asked them why they were even doing Facebook ads? If you're CAC is like £80, why don't you just give people free microwaves for a 3-month commitment, microwaves are cheap these days, like a good one is £70-80 bucks. That would give you instant payback and an insane viral talking point. In fact, if you even know which brand of microwave works best on your meals, you might as well give people that, even if it costs a little more than your CAC, because they'll walk away with a way better product. And if you got big, you probably have co-branding opportunities, maybe the microwave company would even pay you marketing money. They ultimately didn't get my advice. I get it, my ideas can be a little radical.

As a startup founder you build something together with your cofounders, then you grow your team as you scale your product, you raise some money to find your pmf, raise some money again, and sky is the limit if you make it beyond that point. As an indie you need to build 100 traction channels on your own, multiple products, hoping one will make it, share the journey of your potential success just so you can monetize it later through the course, make posts about how did you make it so far just to add your product links in it, build more products, talk about it all day long just to reach maximum of 10-20k a month if you are lucky. Very few at the top are making 1M ARR like Rush, Levels, Postma and Marc just to name a few, and they worked very very hard for many many years, in some cases more then a decade to make it there.

Mostly other engineers, developers and artists, but not much overlap with the investor side of the startup world. We’re building a co-op focused ARPG that’s designed as a Games-as-a-Service title... something in the AA space that emphasizes teamwork and long-term player retention rather than just single-player content with tacked on multiplayer (I hope that's not breaking the rules of mentioning the startup...

Most of the information that is out there is about typical startups that want to get their product to market as soon as they have something that looks like a MVP, which isn't typically what games do.

We’ve had moderate success, able to pay ourselves for years although not a competitive salary. My CTO is a talented back end and full stack gap-filling engineer. I’m the hardware engineer, and I also do essentially everything else to keep the company running. We could both make more money in corporate, but we’re passionate about the company and vision. My CTO has built a lot of software over his years working on our products, but he’s had long periods of utterly minimal contribution due to what I think is undiagnosed depression. There will be months at a time where not a single line of code is written and no PRs are reviewed, but he will show up to meetings, contribute ideas, and coordinate with our contractors, but the often tedious IC work just won’t get done. We’ve managed for this long by just being flexible and accommodating. Hardware derives the majority of revenue and it’s easy to push software deadlines when the apps are free. He will eventually come back around and help move product forward, but in the meantime our software has lagged quite far behind our competitors. We recently announced a new hardware product I’ve worked on basically single handedly for the past couple of years and it went far better than expected. This is my baby, I did everything from customer research, design, firmware, built countless prototypes, and so much more. We have more signed pilots than I can manage with giant multinational companies. Paid pilots are starting in Q4. During this process, our software has been completely stagnant. The new product is going to require an overhaul of the apps, and we’re totally unequipped to make that happen. I’m not sure what to do. My CTO has given so much to this company, and I refuse to screw him over. At the same time, we have an opportunity that’s bigger than anything we’ve had before and I essentially don’t have a CTO, or really a cofounder. I’m afraid that if we take on these deals, and use the money they give us to build out the software side of the company, our lack of software leadership will doom us.

I had founded a logistics company specializing in cargo management and consolidation using our algorithms to maximize load capacity. I started it when I was in college with my then girlfriend (now wife) and literally started from the ground up. We grew the company to 10mil in 5 years and life was good. I had no VCs, angels, just me, my wife and my dad. So things started to get quite boring, every “major” issue became predictable, revenue was growing but not myself. I felt like the business itself had put a cap on my desires and love of the game. So, I got another idea about an app. Bootstrapped it with revenue from my existing company and decided to plunge in the world of Silicon Valley. Logistics was tech heavy but no where near the levels of whatever is happening in the tech space. I am quite technical and have a deep understanding of systems design and architecture. But somewhere in my mind I thought, I am incompetent when it comes to tech. Is anyone going to take me seriously? Fuckin tech bros from meta, google, probably will laugh at my capabilities. So i went the hiring route. I had quite a bit of money and decided, “hey lets hire 3 bright engineers and get the show on the road”. Hiring went well, everyone was aligned and I took a step back because what would a “trucker” know about anything (so I thought) 1 month of development became 2, that became 3 and stretched to 5. I kept thinking, “shit is my idea that complicated?” So I took the word of the devs and stayed off the steering wheel. Just the usual business admin work, make pitch decks, registration and shooting the shit while the devs worked. I hated every second of it. I hated it so much, i started developing apps in the meantime just for fun because this shit was taking too long. Then 1 day it just hit me. I wanted to do an extensive code review and see wtf is going on. The code review yielded that our backend engineer was a sociopath who had graphql, codegen, complex CTE for search, insane amount of tech debt etc. Front end yielded extremely spaghetti code, copy/paste development, essentially give cursor crack and it will write that type of code. Then the backend engineer quit, cause he got too “overburdened”, and my two other engineers were dumbasses and shit was just falling apart infront of me. So i was driving back home from a conference in LA for tech week and me and my wife sat in silence for 30 minutes. Both depressed, and willing to just say, “dump and move on”. I suddenly had an awakening, like, I am an engineer through and through and there is no way in hell I am going to let these 3 clowns screw up everything. I bought a pack of parliament lights, 5 redbulls, and sat down at my desk and started building. It took me 5 hours to get the backend up, and another 20 hours to get the front end up and communicating. I developed the UI/UX and just went ape shit. What took them 5 months I had technically achieved it in 1 day. So we spent 1 week polishing it, making it nice and dandy and just today I submitted it to the app store. So moral of the story. Trust yourself. No matter how god damn technical or competent someone looks on paper, question it, poke holes and see why cant it be done in an easier way. Dont rely on others to do your bidding. If you feel like your project will collapse because your engineer, or employee quits, you havent built the necessary skills to hold the fort for when shit falls apart. Fuck everyone else, fuck what they think and what their opinion is about you. This is the beauty of startups. Just fuckin do it. Dont wait, take the chance, make mistakes, but trust yourself.

(I will not promote) Hey everyone, I’m a 20-year-old university student who’s been pondering/doing some light research on a business idea: a campus-exclusive marketplace that connects students to buy, sell, and rediscover the “essentials of campus life”. The goal is to make university living more affordable, sustainable, and community-driven. Right now, most students use Facebook Marketplace or random group chats for things like textbooks, dorm furniture, sublets, course/exam notes, etc. It works, but it’s messy, spammy, and sometimes unsafe. The idea would focus on verified students only (through their school email), keeping transactions local and trustworthy. As an aspiring entrepreneur, this idea is one of many I’ve explored, but it’s one that feels genuinely rooted in a real problem I see and experience every day.

I will not promote Me and 3 other friends are pursuing a product we want to build. We are at a stage where we've done our research and there is a real use case we can pursue. The issue is we don't know who should be CEO. Of the 4 of us, let's put 2 folks aside as they want to do other things (tech, product, etc.). I'm trying to decide between my friend and me, let's call him John. John and I, while both technical, have business experience. We have overlapping skillsets. John initially suggested we be co-CEOs, but after we talked about my passion for the idea and vision, he said he's okay with me taking the CEO title. Even so, he's a natural leader and has expressed that he wants to be the one talking with investors and getting the money. However, I came in with the idea, I have a vision for execution, and I want to focus on talking with customers and the overall execution. I would like to be at the forefront of signing deals as I have a knack for being a good speaker. John is a PM at his day job so he's really good from an operational delivery standpoint. We've both been told we can sell a product well. The idea revolves around something that I am so much more passionate about. John is a great asset because he comes with business acumen and will probably be more rational. I'm thinking of proposing that I take the CEO title to focus on vision and sales (customer-facing), and John takes a CPO or COO title to own the product/operations and partner with me on fundraising. For context, we are bootstrapping for the first 2-3 years as funding isn't necessary. Our business will require us speaking with other financial institutions at a later point, to which John expressed his interest in spearheading. This seems like a perfect fit for his role.

Our product has shown a brilliant result at the initial stage; we need to redesign it from the prototype to hit the market. We plan to start with the UK and India, and slowly spread to the rest of the world. The challenges we faced/are facing so far are: 1. Very few clinical validations. Many of the dentists refused to share their thoughts on this idea. Others gave a good response. 2. Cheap products: While our product is innovative in the way it works compared to others, the current market is flooded with cheap products from China. Additionally, they can copy ours until we do some clinical trials and IP our results. Currently, it is outside our budget. 3. We have decided to sell it on online sites, to see the public sentiment. Then, slowly adjust with the customer feedback and develop the product. It can again trigger the counterparts and bring in a cheap version of it with less compliance. 4. Funding: Neither my co-founder nor I has a business background, but we are studying a lot lately. How difficult will it be to find funding? We were initially looking for Government funding, but realised it would take longer than usual, so going towards the investors . I'm sure a lot of you have been in this stage, and believe it is better to seek advice rather than failing the same way others did.

It will be a product that will assist disabled and older large dogs. I'm a disabled veteran on a fixed income so I don't just have thousands upon thousands of dollars sitting around that I can throw into building a working prototype. I'm also not an engineer and the product would be way to complicated for me to build even though it would be something super easy and basic to make for someone who is mechanically inclined which I'm simply just not. I honestly tried figuring out what all needed to go into it and what electronic part did what to make it function and I'll be honest it went way over my head so I definitely would need someone to help me build it. I do already have a patent pending status for it so I can share it here. It's a portable platform device that you place next to your car or bed, you guide your dog onto it, and at the press of a button the platform will lift your dog to the surface level of your bed or car and then from there your dog simply walks off the platform and into the car/bed. Once done using you simply lower the platform down/collapse it and then either put it into your car or slide it under your bed. No struggling on behalf of your pet to get up a ramp or stairs. Now back to the funding. I've found an engineer who's willing to build it for around $12k which I simply don't have and there are some other start up costs I would need to cover as well. I started a GoFundMe but haven't had any luck whatsoever. I kept running into an error message when trying to start a Kickstarter campaign which prevented me from doing that.

My ultimate goal is to make this device affordable for the average everyday pet owner and I'm worried that an investor may be greedy and expect me to charge over a thousand dollars for it when my goal is to have it on the market for around $300-$450.

He controlled my every step and if I didn’t notify him that I was going to the store, he always found out about it and made a scandal (his friends often drove cars and just saw me and immediately reported to him). On the one hand, I felt protected and on the other hand (when my friends told me that this was not normal) I understood that this was probably not good. I didn’t have healthy relationships in my family and I couldn’t understand then that his attitude towards me was not ok. Since the topic of sex never came up in our family. I didn't know that it wasn't supposed to be like this until a few years later. He gained the trust of my parents and they loved him with all their hearts. Because I decided that I didn’t want to lose my virginity early, we had anal sex for several years. The first time I really didn’t understand what was happening and just froze in place and let him do what he wanted. I took it for granted and just kept quiet about it. But since anal sex is far from the best thing that could bring me pleasure. Over time, I simply did not want intimacy and it so happened that I refused him, but he could not constantly come to terms with the refusal; he simply began to gradually take me by force. I felt helpless and agreed to it. This lasted about 3 years and my libido is simply destroyed at the moment. Now when I want intimacy with someone, I can’t be treated “good” (foreplay, etc.) now I have the feeling that only the format of rape can turn me on. I view porn mostly only in this format and I am very ashamed of it. I dream of any situations where I would be raped and get excited by it. At the moment I am in a relationship and when my partner wants intimacy, I immediately say no. When this happens, I experience absolutely no orgasm. And over time I simply lose interest in intimacy.

Here's the context: I'm a live in caregiver(26F) taking care of an elderly man in his home. I work 3 weeks on 1 week off. I've lived here for over a year now and the first year was horrible because of his pipe smoking which became more frequent over time, he smokes around maybe 8 times a day. On top of this, one of his kids(60m) even tried to make a move on me and I had to make a boundary that I wasn't interested. I finally have gotten over the fact that I can't really change the way they see me but I'm tired of fighting for basic respect. They have tried other ways to make it better for me such as buying a really expensive $500 air purifier that really doesn't make much of a difference and I never felt good about in the first place which I expressed but I tried it anyways wanting to appease them. Finally we came to an understanding that he needs to smoke in his room and things have been great. Until it came time to leave for my break and they said it was up to the other caregiver if she enforced the rule that he smoke in his room otherwise he can smoke in the living room as he pleases. Well, the other caregiver, despite my pleas, doesn't care and allows him to smoke in the living room. Of course I hate the smoke and the smell it leaves, the thought of all the chemicals that stay in the room long after the smell is gone, but the worst part of all this is that obviously its horrible for my clients health as well. Ive tried to explain to his kids how much better he feels when he smokes less, he sleeps better, he's less irritable, his mood improves, but no one cares. The way they see it he's gonna die anyways so why not let him do whatever he wants? Which is fair but also I truly love and care about him and he's not addicted to the pipe smoking, he just enjoys it. Since he has to smoke in his room he smokes way less or not at all, and I feel so much better. He hasn't smoked all week out of his own choice. When I finally worked up the nerve to request that he also smoke in his room even while I'm off work the message I received was : \"when you are not at \\*redacted address, he can smoke in the living room, when you are at \\*redacted address he smokes in his room.\" Am I the asshole for wanting to fight back and still ask that he smoke in his room even while I'm away? I don't have a home of my own, all of my things are packed away boxes at my mom's house. I barely even have a place here, but I spend the majority of my time here. I love this job, I'm grateful for the opportunity, and the pay I receive, but I'm tired of being walked all over. I wanted to go back to my family for thanksgiving but now I'm genuinely thinking of staying here just to have sovereignty over my living space. I feel insane for this. Am I overreacting? I make really good money being here. Maybe it's that they think I should pay rent to have a say? I don't understand why this is even still being negotiated I have a really hard time understanding where they're coming from. If anyone has a different perspective or there's something I'm not getting please let me know. I need to figure out how too handle this. Last time we had a discussion about this they said I would be let go if it didn't work out and they would find someone to replace me. Then they said he would go to a home. I think they don't know what to do if I would leave, and yes I'm biased, but also I genuinely believe they would not be able to find someone nearly half as good as me. At the time I wasn't really happy here anyways and I almost felt relieved not to have the responsibility, but now that I've become more attached to my client I want to take care of him as long as I can.

THEN my sir is like NO NO -name- STOP DONT GO ANYHWERE WAIT and kicked out everyone but me and my band. he then proceeds to say that i'm acting like he's the student and i'm the teacher and i should come talk to him after i've completely grade 8 in piano, guitar and some other instrument. he also mentioned how his english is bad and mine is good so i think i'm smarter than him??? i never mentioned that so idek what he's saying but i was really hurt and pissed about this. this is a person i looked up to. then i apologised, he said its fine and i took my members and went to the supervisor AGAIN, complained he's not letting us practice and he told us to go sit in the music room. we three went down to the music room (it was empty because he had a substitution in some other class) and we js sat there. the two boys left for sth and the dude who talked w me came back. he mentions how the other guy doesnt like me because i disrespected the teacher. btw, this guy is a great guitarist but he's also an incel + he always gets chances to perform and stuff without working for it, so i don't really think you should say this to someone who's actually TRYING for a performance where YOU'LL be performing but whatever. then this dude comes like \"bro the supervisors shitting on the teacher in the hall\" and then a few mins later both of them come inside. the supervisor mentions a few things and then he says that he will coordinate w the music teacher and let us go in the free periods he has.

I don’t remember anything from the incident due to the nature of it, but my friends keep on insisting it was traumatic for them, and one of them is now unable to take calls in there day-to-day life. Obviously it was traumatic for both of them, I would never sit here and say it wasn’t, but what happened after the incident is making me feel a bit iffy. - They distanced themselves quite a bit, to the point where I was sedated most of the time due to my hysteria - Left me alone in the hospital, even after saying a few weeks prior that if I was admitted they would visit - Never reached out unless I reached out first to ask if they were okay, or if one of them was able to drop my stuff off (which ended up happening two days after) I ended up turning to a long distance friend, and between me being sedated and being lucid, I was able to remember four things that happened from the incident. I got discharged on Saturday, and after finally getting in contact with one of my friends they said they were both heavily traumatised from what I did and were taking space during my time in hospital. When I told him I couldn’t remember anything, he said he thought that was the case but never really acknowledged it. He then said he wanted my love location at all times, and if it turned off he would call the police.

It was a messy divorce that lasted about a year. After the year, a lot of things happened at once: First, my father introduced my sister and I to his new girlfriend Lisa (fake name). My parents had kept the details of their divorce from us, but I had a feeling that my dad had started seeing Lisa before he divorced my mom. The timing of it all was too suspicious, but I couldn't prove anything. My mom flat out told me that my father cheated on her, but during the divorce she became a different person. She was set on getting full custody and getting my sister and I to hate my dad. During that time she said a lot of mean things about him to me, some I knew were completely fabricated. So when she told us that dad had cheated on her with Lisa, I wasn't sure if that was the truth or another lie she told us to make us take her side. When it was time to decide custody, my parents left for us to decide who we wanted to live with. At the time both of us were not minors anymore, so there wasn't a legal custody question. Now here is where I might be the asshole. At the time, my dad and Lisa were moving to a different city. This was a bigger city with much better college and job prospects. Also, my dad earns a lot more money than my mom. So choosing to live with him would mean not only living more comfortably, but also in a city where I would get to choose a better college instead of settling for what's near. Lisa was not a bad person: she treated me well and seemed to genuinely want a relationship with me. So I decided to move in with them. My mom was hurt by my decision but told me it was okay and that she understood I needed to think about my future. However, after coming back to my hometown to visit my mom and my mom's family, I was met with open hostility. My aunts and uncles now all hate me and treat me like I betrayed my family. A cousin that I am closest with told me they never forgave me for \"abandoning\" my mother after the divorce. Apparently, since my mother didn't have a job after the divorce, she was counting on getting full custody and receiving child support after the divorce, but since we chose to live with my dad, she was left with no money and had to rely on her brothers and sisters.

He's reluctant. If you've read my previous post in another subreddit, you'll know that I shouldered a lot of the family's mental load (eldest daughter stereotype, I know). I've been asked to settle marital and financial disputes before. My father threatened to throw my mother and brother to the street should I ever move out. The latest problem is my brother, who have been dependent on my parents for allowances, a year after his graduation. He's not actively job searching, and prefers to trying his hands on being a youtuber. It is a feasible career in this day and age, but I'm under the impression that youtubers tend to work day-jobs until their internet career takes off and starts generating profits. Moreover, my country is currently experiencing economic turmoil, just like any other country currently. Thus, me and my parents are all worried about experiencing layoffs. We're extremely worried that when the time comes to tighten the household budget, my brother will not accept that since currently he is subsidized by my parents on food, internet, heating, A/C, and even sometimes his streaming devices. I don't know how to give any advice to my brother. I'm the bookworm that had only touch a technological device after I enter high school, and even then I did not follow internet culture until few years ago. I don't understand much about a youtuber or influencer's career. I know a lot of people have been telling me to move out in my last post, and I have been trying to save whatever pennies I have left. I'm considering some things. How much should I save to permanently move out, so I don't have to move back in the future? Should I try at all to try and talk my brother into finding a job? Will he listen? A lot of internet articles say if an adult is reluctant to get a job, they might have depression. Then should I help or will he latch on me instead for money if ever my parents cut support for him? I know I'm the pushover type and am so afraid that they'd all just pressure me and I'd yield (my father even borrowed a large sum of almost a third of my savings and he hasn't paid it back, so far as to push the payment deadline three times).

Prior to all this, we had the type of relationship with our family where we would meet up with our parents and grandparents once a week to eat lunch with them. This was the main way our family interacted outside of some individual time with my brother. Also, my grandmother has dementia, and while she can still do some things for herself, I think she’s in the more moderate stages. She doesn’t appear to remember most of her life. About 2 years ago, randomly, my older brother confided in me that our grandmother sexually assaulted him when he was a kid, and he asked if this ever happened to me too. This threw me for a loop a bit. My grandma has literally been nothing but perfect to me my entire life. I think, in the moment, I responded well to my brother. But then things got messy. My brother made me swear to not tell anyone. At the same time, I didn’t want to spend time every week with my rapist grandmother anymore. Even if he could tolerate it, I felt like I couldn’t. He had no intention of telling anyone else (partially bc of grandma’s dementia), and he just wanted to continue on as if nothing was different. This next part is what I want feedback on. I feel like an asshole for how it all went down. I still don’t know what to make of it. After like 2 weeks of pretending all is fine, I drove over to my parents house and told them I wasn’t going to be doing our weekly lunches anymore. I said I couldn’t tell them why, but I just was going to stop coming. My parents were pretty upset, and my mom tells my brother that I’m doing this. Then, he drives over to my parents house and tells them about the abuse. Seemingly, he felt like he had to give them a reason for my desired absence from the family at that point. For like a year, he was so pissed with me. He basically felt like I forced his hand to come out about the SA. He felt like I should have just kept my head down and not change anything. But I just felt so wrong pretending like everything is normal and fine. It was never my intention to force his hand. I just didn’t want to spend two hours a week sitting around with my rapist grandmother. As time has passed, my relationship with my brother has improved some, but it honestly feels like it will never be as good as it was. Now, our mother feels guilty that the abuse happened, and I know my brother still feels like that’s my fault. Like if I would have just kept the status quo, my mother wouldn’t have to deal with this guilt. Also the vibes just feel very different now that everyone knows. I just want some people’s thoughts on the situation. It all feels so bizarre to me.

So, I (23F) recently completed my Pharm D. During our final year, we had to form thesis groups of six students.

The rest, including my best friend, were more laid-back and just wanted to get it over with. My best friend immediately assumed we’d be in the same thesis group. We’ve been close since first year, and we’ve done every assignment together. But when I realized how unmotivated most of the others were, I decided to join the group with the other student who was more serious about research. I wanted to make sure my thesis turned out well because it really affects our grades and future academic prospects. When I told my best friend that I wouldn’t be joining her group, she was hurt. She said I’d “chosen grades over friendship” and that “a real friend wouldn’t leave her behind.” I tried to explain that a thesis isn’t just another project. It’s a major academic milestone, and I didn’t want to risk poor coordination or weak quality because of mismatched priorities. Now, she barely speaks to me.

We're on our final day of a week long stay at an all inclusive hotel in Spain. We're a couple with a young toddler. The buffet restaurant has a reasonably large outdoor seating area which we have used all week without issue. This morning we went outside for breakfast and there was one free table with two coffees on it. Often people leave, and the staff haven't gotten to clear the table yet, so we assumed it was free. I went inside and got a high chair for the baby and as we were sitting him into it at the table a middle aged lady came and said \"That's our table, didn't you see the coffee we left on it?\". I replied \"You can't reserve a table with a cup of coffee\" and my wife added that we thought they were left by someone who had finished. I said that she should just sit at the table and take turns to go to the buffet if she wanted to keep it. She replied that we have to do that because of the baby, but they don't. She offered to share the table and I said ok, how many of you are there. \"Three\" she replied, so I said well that won't work at a table for four. Meanwhile, a table beside us became free and we moved to that. Her family arrived, husband and teenage son. She said \"why didn't you just take that clearly empty table in the first place?\" to which I replied that it was occupied until moments ago. That was the end of it, or so I thought until 10 minutes later when the family were leaving and the husband stopped as he passed us to say \"Enjoy your holiday, you arrogant bastard\". I should have held my tongue but I couldn't help but calmly saying \"you're a scumbag\". So, AITAH here? It bugs me when people try to claim a table like that and it hasn't been an issue all week.

On Halloween I went to a party with my friends and he stayed home because he had work in the morning. Long story short I made a tik tok in my costume and he saw it and then got rlllllyyy upset. I was dressed as poison ivy, my costume consisted of a green corset with green bikini bottoms and tights with heels. He was upset because of the bikini bottoms. He said it was disrespectful to go out like that when I have a bf. We’ve been together for 4 years in December so the way he reacted was completely immature to me, while he was getting upset at me I was getting upset back and I ended up saying “you say your not insecure but look at how your acting” and he didn’t like me calling him insecure, mind you he is. I’m not allowed to have guy friends, he gets upset when I have celebrity crushes (jokingly but deep down he’s serious) I just know it’s better to not say anything about men in general cus he takes it a certain way. I’ve given him no reason to believe that I would be unloyal. I’ve given him my all for the past 4 years,I don’t even follow any men on social media. I’ve gotten up at 3 in the morning just to make him coffee before work. I honestly make so many sacrifices for him. For him to just text me and say I want attention when god forbid I just wanna feel good on Halloween. Our argument escalated and after I called him insecure he said “ok then I’m going to go to a strip club since your not insecure” so I replied “see how fast you loose your girl” I don’t know how everyone else feels about strip clubs, and I’m all for the hustle but to me going to a strip club is beyond disrespectful when your in a relationship. After that he said something along the lines of “you dress like that I might as well go look at other sluts” so obviously that’s crazy. After that he didn’t text back but I sent him a long paragraph and I basically told him to reflect. I mentioned how I’ve never been unloyal or have given him a reason to think I’ve been. I wear bikini bottoms and it’s never been an issue like if anything the tights were better lol. He then turned off his location and we haven’t talked at all, he did send me one text saying “hey, I’m going to want to talk in person but I want a couple days away” I’m not itching to talk to him. He was beyond disrespectful to me and I haven’t felt good about us. I don’t know what to do. I don’t want to leave him, he’s all I’ve known for 4 years.

But AITAH for not helping them My parents have zero knowledge of financial planning and how to make money work for themselves. Their idea of financial planning is to save money. Anything other form of investment is gambling to them. As mentioned in the title my parents bought a new house. It's a great 2bhk flat, located 5 mins away from where I used to stay earlier. But this flat came with it's own set of traumas that I have had to bear and am still dealing with it. To set some context of why I don't want to help my family, more specifically my mother. My mother has been sort off the sole earning member of our house with a stable job and income till I started earning, as my father was into transportation and goat farming businesses which failed miserably and has been jobless for majority of his supposed peak years. Now the Goat farm business that my father started was funded by my mother. Who helped him buy the land and get a loan to fund that whole thing. On the side my father's cousins they were also starting their own restaurant in the same area and asked my father if he would like to invest. My father said yes, as the deal was that we'll invest 12L and after 3 years he'll repay us 15L as initial investment + interest. This is taking place in 2014-15. On the side they went on to buy another piece of land nearby which is near a man made lake and is known to be submerged under water when the lake has enough water. That Goat farming business failed miserably. Later on we got to know that my father has also taken money from multiple other people, that too not from him but directly from those people when they were standing in front of house demanding money from my Mother, which she had no idea was taken as a loan. When she confronted him all he had to say was he did it for the business - for the family. Amidst that my mother also found out that my father had sold my the gold chain that was made for me. Again, did this for family, he was help less, needed the money. Eventually my mother paid off the bank and these other people that my father had borrowed money from, while not getting a single penny out of both - the goat farm and the restaurant. Cut to 2022. They got to know about the current building that we're living in and did the maths that with the 15L from the restaurant + rent from the flat that we were living in + loan, we could make ends meet. The installament comes to something of 60k-70k. They booked the flat applied for loan, barring the 15L from the loan as that would have increase the installment amount. Cut to 2024. The construstion of building is done. The loan has paid the builder the money, barring the 15L. Now my mother who was always behind my father to get an agreement made for the 15L that we're supposed to get cause other than the 3-4 people involved in the deal no one has any idea that we've given money. Though they kept telling the whole world that it's 'our' restaurant as well, on paper it wasn't. But my father kept saying it will create an issue between him and the uncle and that he'll manage it. Eventually my mother lost it and called that uncle. To her horror the uncle told her that he has already paid my dad 13L rules till now and only 2L is remaining. She told him that she never got a penny. Then he sent the whole register of the money he has given my dad. These were all small sums ranging from 5k - 70k that my dad had taken from him over the year. When she confronted him all he had to say was he used that money for the business - a business that was failing and there was no hope of it reviving. There are goat farms that have literally zero infrastructure and are successful. My dad poured 60L into this business + 13L from the restaurant only to claim that he tried and his exact words were - ' I tried to do something for y'all but since it didn't workout everyone is blaming me and I can't do anything about it nor do I want to do anything anymore. I'm just sitting here minding my own business ' My mother had to sell of her jewellery, get some more loan from local lenders for the surplus + interior cost + house warming rituals (that I told not to be so lavish about but still they went ahead cause people will say, 'they bought a house this big but couldn't arrange a fest for 100 people) The installament has now gone up to 80-85k for someone with a salary of 1.2L after taxes. So I told them to sell of the goat farm as that land can get us easy 50-60L and the loan amount of 1 cr reduces down to 40L/ she can buy another house in my old society and put it up on rent and get stable income from there. But no they don't want to sell that no income land cause those are their roots and the land that they had purchased can't be sold of as well, since it's submerged under the lake water and the predicted resell value of 5-7L is now a dream since the water level is consistent unlike back then when water was scarce.🙃 Now comes the part of why I don't want to help them out of this whole mess that they have created. My mother keeps playing the victim even when she knows what's happening is wrong and can easily just say no. She's scared of my father walking away( even though he financially can't ) and if living alone as my parents have sort of trauma bonded with each other over their 32 years of marriage. My whole life I have had to beg for everything that was provided to me. For example - when I was in school (2005-15) my friends used to get pocket money for safety/ reserved money in case needed. I had to be begging my parents for 50rs after semester ends to just be able to have a fankie that other kids used to eat almost every other day, and even then they would say that I've a spoiled attitude. There was a time around 2014-15 when I didn't have clothes to wear to any sort of social gatherings. If asked to buy my parents would tell me that they didn't have any money. While I understand money was an issue, and it's not something they were doing intentionally. But my issue with them is that they haven't even loved me or made me ever feel safe. The traumas they have given me just for being a child and doing the childish stuff that everyone does affected me so much that, it took me 10 years and some good empathetic friends to overcome it's effects. List of some traumas that I have not been able suppress out of my memories: - I was thrown out of my house at the age of 5-6, without even an underwear on, while it was raining heavily outside. Why? Cause I didn't study. - my Indian parents would best the shit out of me for protecting myself against kids who would bully me. Why? Cause talli ek haath se nahi bajti (only one person can't be wrong, even I must have done something) - they would not let me go out with my society friends. Why? Cause they're not as well mannered as they would like them to be and they don't come from a household which they want to associate with. - going out for trips meant going to my parents hometown and staying there for the entirety of it was the most boring part of my summer vacations, as all the kids who I could hangout, even my cousins would go to their hometown or out of city for vacations. - In 9th I was once given a budget of Rs200 to get myself something to wear since I had to go to a friend's birthday party held at a restaurant. I went out the whole day and found a t-shirt that was in budget and looked fine for a party. Went home showed them the t-shirt, everyone appreciated how I was able to manage. Then on the day of the birthday I was not allowed to go to the party. Why? Cause it isn't out culture to be celebrating a birthday party in a restaurant which also serves alcohol. - they won't even let me hang out with my school friends cause that meant giving me money which was also quite less (Rs 80-100) cause my parents used to take out all the family friends kids (9-12) for snacks and dinners randomly (at another restaurant which also serves alcohol as well) . Call extended family over or let them use our house like a guest house for however long they want, as this was their way of maintaining those relationships. While when it was the other way round those same relatives and parents of those kids won't even buy a chocolate for me or the other kids. - at family functions when everyone used to speak candidly, tease and make fun of each other regardless of the age gap (even my parent would be making fun/made fun of my kids 10-15 years younger) I used to get scolded in front of everyone for the same things, even when it was directed to someone in my age group. - They would never take my side if anything went wrong or someone came home to complain about me doing some random thing which quite frankly were never anything serious. Just petty things for which the other parents were literally bashing other kids/parents even when they were wrong. And the minute I would enter my house I would be thrased like anything cause I brought shame to this house my doing such a thing. - Till date whenever I fall sick no one has every checked up on me. But when they get my parents get even a paper cut it's all how I don't care and then instead of helping each other out or going to the doctor would expect we to start doing thier work. - They paid 6L for my culinary school, which till date I keep hearing. Why? Cause I wanted to pursue something that I liked and didn't pursue B.Sc IT like the other family friends kids who was always into computers or the other kid who did engineering cause he didn't really have an issue with it, while he was preparing for armed force trials and exams and his family was more than happy for him to not work and just focus on those exams. - From 11th - till I graduated ( 5 years) I was given 1k per month (Rs 36/day) as pocket money. In which I had to manage my travel, food, and any other expense that incurs. I used to travel for 1 hour by train and then walk 30 mins to college. - When I started earning they wanted all salary to themselves, and would give me pocket money from my own salary. Which meant that I would have to again beg and negotiate with them for my own money while justifying why I needed the money. The Trigger point I've been giving my mom 10k every month from the time when my salary was 18k back in 2022 and after moving into the new house I started giving her 15k since the installment. While my salary is now 43k. So 28k is what I have for myself. Now I've been over indulging myself when it came to eating out, buying clothes for myself, going on trips For the past 4 years the bike I've been using is a 2nd hand Discover 150, which is in total 10 years old. Now my bike has been having engine issues lately and the whole engine has been rebuilt once. The bike is way past it's time and should have been retired a year back itself. But I kept getting it repaired since I was also getting to terms with fullfiling all the things I was denied off and have spent every penny that I've earned to just experience the pleasure of these menial things. As I hit 26, 3 months back, I came to a point where my future became more important to me than my past, as I've been able to resolve/ come to terms with most of my issues. So saving money and investing it right, hitting the gym, eating clean and healthy, and improving my skills as a filmmaker became my priority. But last week my bike caught fire out of nowhere, luckily the watchman put out the fire in no time and close to no damage was done to bike, but the whole wiring was been burnt to a crisp and needs to be replaced. This incident made me realise that I need to get a new bike, as I need it to travel to office and other places. Helping me save time and money. So I told me mom that I won't be able to give you the usual amount of 15k as I have more or else 5-6 months on my bike before it completely crashes out and needs to be replaced and before that happens I need to save atleast 70% of the total price that the bike I want is priced at. So that she told me that I should leave the house if I'm not willing to pay. Cause I don't consider this family and house, 'MY' family and house. This is not the first time that I've been told to leave the house over money matters/ difference of opinion. At this point atleast once a month I get told to leave the house cause I'm not adhering to their beliefs or lifestyle. If I point out their wrong doings it's cause that how the world works and if I show them the mirror then I'm disrespecting them and honestly I don't even consider them my family. My friends have done more for me than my supposed family has ever done. They only talk to me/ show concern when they want money. My whole perspective about love has become so bad that I've no idea what genuinely being loved and cared for feels like. At this point I just do whatever I feel is necessary for myself and treat them as haters/trollers. I haven't left this house yet, even though I can now afford to cause I don't need to spend that extra energy and money which would go in rent, shifting, adjusting and managing. I can very well just ignore them and when shit hits the fan I let lose and give them back the same rage and hate that they used to speak at me when I was a kid. Right now the plan is to save 15k for my bike invest 5k and give my mother 5k to keep her shut and use the 18k for my own expenses. AITAH for not helping my Family out?

By that I mean sexted with ex flings and random women on Instagram. The first time was a shock, I forgave him and told him to not do it again. Second time still shocked,, we went to couples therapy and he Uninstalled insta and deleted what I thought was all ex affairs. Idk why maybe its because he always did it the past 2 years sometime after Halloween before winter-- I had the urge to check his phone. Something I rlly never do bc I always had the mentality I just dont wanna know. And I found this in his deleted chats with a profile named Megan. Bf: Hey can we talk M: Whats going on M: ? Bf: I've been trying to get ahold of you M: About? Bf: I just wanted to apologize and just have a conversation if you want to Bf: About it M: Im confused Bf: About? M: Apologize for what? Bf: I had you blocked for a little while and wanted to apologize and talk to you about it. I dont want to just not have a conversation M: it's all good, no hard feelings Bf: I know youre mad ive known you for years can we just talk about it Bf: You even text different M: I'm honestly not mad, just confused that's all. Plus Chase was about to send a Pic of his nuts since you were blowing me up Bf: im sorry it wasnt my goal to do that I just needed space for a bit for my own reasons and after a while I realized I treated you badly for nothing and you did nothing to deserve that and im sorry. I should've vocalized that instead of ghosting you Bf: well usually you respond on Insta fine and you kept me on seen so i assumed you were just pissed Bf: also gross M: Its all good! I understand you have a gf and stuff to handle. And yeah he does that when men wont leave me alone, usually works M: it wasnt because of that Megan. And yeah does he know we're texting now? Bf: it was for a different reason M: yes. He knows you are apologizing for something. What is the reason Bf: Well that's between us its not a specific event more so a general thing For now I just wanted to apologize genuinely because I value you as a friend I really do and I treated you badly and for that im sorry. If you want to talk about the reason at a later time when you have the privacy you can text me whenever but im not gonna say anything right now that was between me and you and it'll stay between me and you its not anyone else's business even your bfs We've known each other for years and its been an ongoing thing M: im at work. He's not with me. He has my insta logged in on his phone Bf: You getting off soon? And would you like me to tell you the reason or? M:i dont get off until 12, answer yes Bf: well I mean its like I said its been a general thing since the start but every time we talk I start to catch feelings for you. I've had a thing for you literally since the day we first talked and I dont know why and it becomes a lot harder to ignore sometimes And then add the history we have and my more darker desires to it and its a very intense wave of feelings M: ah gotchya. Well we can stop talking if that'll make it easier Bf: No Megan. I care about you and value you. I enjoy talking to you too --end-- That's it for now because im watching the video I took on his phone and typing in everything and kinda having a mental breakdown. WIBTAH if I end it over this?

I’m aware this is stupid and I may be in the wrong here but please be nice with your honesty. I’m not looking for judgment, I really just want to know if I am in the wrong. I have also not made a decision yet. I (19 f) am turning 20 soon and I want to have a birthday party. For some context, I haven’t had a birthday party in over 3 years because I struggled with friends in high school. Last year I asked for a birthday party since I made new really awesome friends in my first year of university. My parents said no since my sister (21 f) who was turning 21 at the time wanted something big for her 21st which would cost quite a bit of money. I didn’t have an issue with it and I still don’t since 21 is a big number and it usually gets a big party. This year however I asked my parents for a party way in advance since my birthday is in November and I like planning earlier. They said yes and I’m really excited to finally have one with all my new friends. The problem started a few days ago though. My sister texted me while she was out asking if i wanted to have a joint birthday party since her birthday is in December. I didn’t want to say no right away and make her upset while she should be having fun so I told her we can chat when she gets home. She said that she wouldn’t change the theme and is happy with a costume party like I asked. I mean I guess the idea isn’t horrible. The issue is- as awful as it sounds- that I really don’t want to have to compromise with certain things like the cake flavour I want and the people I have already invited. I know how selfish it all sounds but I really want to have a nice party considering that I haven’t had one on a very long time. She did bring up costs at some point but the thing is I’ve already sorted out how I can make it reasonable. I’ll provide non alcoholic drinks and no more than three alcoholic drinks such as champagne which won’t be a “help yourself” thing like the regular cool drinks. And Ive said to my friends that if they want something specific they can bring it for themselves such as vodka or certain brands of alcohol seeing as it’s not very cheap. This may also seem silly to ask of friends, however we do it for everyone’s parties. If we want something specific, we bring it, but I digress. I will also be using my own money for the cake and the alcohol since it can be pricey. I think it is reasonable seeing as the only things I would not pay for would be regular cool drinks and cake. I’m really overthinking this because parts of me wouldn’t mind this at all, but other parts want a day about me.

It’s not serious, just discomfort. I didn't ask him or expect him to bath the baby because he feels discomfort. He knows about my infection and has seen me in pain. Today, we needed to bathe the baby. He asked me if *I* could do it. I was surprised and honestly upset, because bending, lifting, and leaning over the tub hurts and he knows that. I told him I’m not feeling well enough, and he got annoyed. I got upset that he even asked in the first place, because it felt like he wasn’t considering how much pain I’m in. He ended up raising his voice and told me I’m “crazy” for being upset because “he was just asking a question.” For me, it wasn’t just a question. It felt like he minimized what I’m going through and acted like my pain didn’t matter. Meanwhile *his* discomfort is something I’m always careful about and try to accommodate. I tried to explain that it hurt that he asked *me* to do something physically difficult when he knows I’m dealing with an infection, and instead of apologizing or acknowledging it, he doubled down and treated me like I was being irrational. He then started cursing at me under his breath. Now he’s pissed off because I’m pissed off. He says I’m overreacting. I'm pissed off and disappointed.

I have been thinking for a while whether to post this or not . I’m really sorry in advance if this is gonna be a bit long :(( I 20F have been friends with Evie 21F since January when we met on a trip during the Christmas break . Since the moment we met we just clicked . We became inseparable. Even tho We have been only friends for not a long time , we have always been there for each other , had each other’s back and shared so many memories together while also travelling together . We just had a really pure friendship . Since I met her I have always noticed that she has been a really insecure person and can’t get over her ex no matter what , she just stalks him , wants to know everything he is doind and occasionally texts him but at the same time she talks to several boys on snap which tbh I first found it super weird , but I have always thought since it doesn’t have anything to do with me and since she is a good friend to me I can be friends with her , guess I was wrong So last Saturday I woke up to some messages by her asking me if I had texted her ex boyfriend . I kinda got confused because she knows I’m not that type of person to just text people online and I have never been on a relationship before . Anyways I told her no , explaining there was no way I did that when I don’t even know his name nor his face , but most importantly I would have never do such thing to her since she is my best friend . Evie continued saying she had heard from someone ( she didn’t tell me who) that one of her friends talks to her ex . I tried not to take it personally like she referred to me and suggested that person was probably lying or trying to manipulate her . I told her even if it’s true she shouldn’t care . But most importantly I told her she is wasting her time still thinking about him when he probably has moved on and she needs to move on too . I told her she deserves someone better in her life who doesn’t treat her like trash and needs to forget him . I’m not sure i did the right thing by telling her to move on , but she completely lost it . She immediately started accusing me of me being the one who talks to her ex , said how disappointed she was for trusting me , said I only have seen the good side of her and at the end cursed me out . I just froze and was shocked how she would think I would do that , I tried to respond as calm as possible trying to convince myself thatshe was just nervous and didn’t mean that even though it hurt . I told her that if she really knew me , my character, my personality she wouldn’t even ask that question , let alone accuse me . Seeing how frustrated she was I told her to just get out , get some fresh air and text me once she was calm . She didn’t text me and we didn’t talk for the rest of the day so I decided to check on her the next day but she didn’t show any sign of regret ,she only apologised when I asked her and continued saying that every time she is angry she just yells at everyone and beats them up if they talk back to her and with me she acted very reasonably and had never been this calm before . I absolutely lost it there . I couldn’t be calm anymore bc the disrespect was so loud . I told her that in 20 years of my life haven’t been treating like this by no friend nor enemy and I also haven’t once yelled at her from the day I met her even if sometimes I might be angry , because I’m going through depression and hard times and it’s sometimes hard for me to always be positive . And at the end I told her not to share with me anything important about her life since she doesn’t trust and I also told her I’m not coming to her diploma ceremony because I don’t wanna go somewhere I don’t feel respected . I might have gone too far by saying that . Now it’s been days without us talking , she likes my stories , I like hers too but nothing else . She had her diploma ceremony yesterday and she was wearing that outfit she had always been talking about . I sent her a message congratulating her but I honestly feel kinda sad we don’t talk like we used to , but at the same time I can’t fully forgive her . I deserve to surround myself with calm people who make me forget about me depression not people who bring drama . I get it she might be insecure and need therapy but if she really wanted our friendship to continue she would have texted me right ?", "title": "AITAH for wanting to cut off my friend after she asked me if I text her ex bf ?", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1omehlh/aitah_for_wanting_to_cut_off_my_friend_after_she/", "author": "Regular-Advance-8513", "score": 2, "subreddit": "AITAH", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:11Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:11.123230"}

So, I (20F) live with my mom (50F), and she can be a bit too much sometimes. We both woke up pretty late today, and for breakfast, she asked me to order eggs and milk. But when she saw the prices, she decided to go get them herself from the grocery store downstairs. When she came back, I went to make scrambled eggs for myself while she was making tea. She waved me off and said, “I’ll make it for you, don’t worry,” so I left the kitchen and went to my room to freshen up. Later, I smelled mustard oil which I absolutely cannot stand and when I entered the kitchen, I saw her using the same pan that had been sitting in the sink all night with water. The pan was clearly not cleaned; it still had stains and bits of food stuck to the inside of the rim. When I asked if she had cleaned it, she insisted that she had. I asked what she used to clean it, and she said she “just put warm water in it and rinsed it,” which was obviously a lie because the pan still looked dirty. I blew up at her because she kept justifying it, saying she was making me eggs and that it’s “so hard to please me.” Additional context: I was somewhat sick a few days ago, and I’ve had food poisoning more than 10 times this year. I’ve had to visit doctors multiple times and even got blood tests done twice because the doctor was confused about what was causing it. I’ve spent a lot on medication and doctor visits since my mom refused to pay for anything, saying, “If you can spend money on fast food, you can afford a doctor’s bill.” At first, I thought the food poisoning was from eating out, so in October, I completely avoided eating outside food but I still got food poisoning twice that month. She kept saying she “rinsed it once” (without using soap or a scrub) and started going on about how she works 15 hours a day, how she was doing something nice for me, and how I’m an entitled brat who’s never satisfied. She wouldn’t stop, so I called her out for lying and told her she always doubles down even when she’s caught. Eventually, she stopped talking to me but came back later and apologized. A few hours later, when I thought everything had settled down, she came into my room with red, puffy eyes and said how disappointed she was, that I had no right to make her cry, and that my behavior is “just like my dead father’s.” She said she works day and night and that I still don’t listen to her (even though I was originally making the eggs myself).

I didn’t make a fuss and just grabbed some tissue to clean it up before we started. The guy said sorry and I said it was ok (I’m a really chill person, it’s a bit of sweat, cool) - here I thought all was ok. Next minute I look up and I can see the guy bitching about it to the PT. I ignored it. When it came to the end of the class I was sat on the floor and the man who apologised asked me if I was tired, I said yes quietly and then he said it again but with a more harsh tone. I felt a little bullied here. As I’m walking out the second man is bitching about the situation to another member as I’m walking out.

MIL DRAMA: Warning this post is going to be a long one I’m so sorry! For context: My husband and I have been married for 1 month, we’ve been together for 6 years and engaged for 2 years. The relationship with my mother in law prior to getting engaged was great, we would have dinners together occasionally, we went on trips together, and spent holidays together - never any tension or weird energy from anyone. However, the moment he popped the question his mother’s attitude changed completely - she started calling me another woman’s name every time she was around me. Obviously I asked my fiancé who this person was and it was one of her coworkers… His mom would talk about this girl in detail every time she was around me, inviting young girls to their house (we weren’t living together at this point in time and his mom is approaching 60 having young girls as friends) and asking my fiance to talk to these girls. Obviously once he told me about this I thought it was odd behavior but did not approach the subject with his mom. I’m secure in my relationship with him and just brushed this behavior off. Now fast forward to us moving out and getting our own place, she was very controlling on the lay out of the house, telling me all her ideas for the furniture and being over all pretty overbearing.. I just figured that she was excited for us and didn’t give it much thought.. once we were moved in though any changes I made to her original lay out, she would question me on when she would be over spending time with us, essentially wanting explanations on why. This was when I started to feel uncomfortable with being around her, the controlling behavior was sending red flags my way, I felt physically uncomfortable being around her when one day I came home and the woman who she has been messing up my name with, my MIL, and fiance are at the house together… Obviously at this point I’m getting frustrated with her because this is over stepping to me, she didn’t ask me or my fiance if she could bring this person to our house?! (My fiance was painting the bedroom and the girls were in our sub room - I questioned my fiance on this and he said he had no idea she was there.) Then in the weeks leading up to the wedding her behavior escalated DRASTICALLY she got upset with me because I told her no to a plus one on her guest list simply because I had already turned in the guest count to the venue and I did not want to be charged - she called the venue behind my back and added the plus one and I got the email of the charge pending the day of our rehearsal. On rehearsal day she came up to me and pointed at the precessional order and asked “why is this like that??” In a stern tone - had she asked politely I would have changed it but because of her tone and already f***ing me over with an additional charge after my family and I spent THOUSANDS on this wedding I told her “this is staying as it is because this is what the officiant has and the DJ” - it was a bogus lie on my end but at this point I was so over her behavior. During the actual rehearsal we were lined up and my bridesmaid told me to go up to the front because their changing the order and I was seeing red at this point, I walked up there and stood my ground that the order was remaining the way I had it, the entire time I’m speaking his mom is scoffing and says “it’s just a line” which I just completely ignored because if I addressed anything with her I was going to be mean and didn’t want to cause drama on our special day. After dinner my father and I walked up to her to thank her for planning the rehearsal for us, she did not turn around or acknowledge we were talking to her, I literally was talking to the back of her head. It was this moment that I knew she was going to do what she could to ruin my wedding day, and I was right! The day of the wedding she was an absolute nightmare, she showed up and the energy emanating off of her was tangible and made everyone uncomfortable, she sat in the corner of the room and stayed on her phone, she never spoke one word to me the entire day, she refused to wear the pajamas I bought for her to wear while getting ready, I got her a bag with multiple gifts in it and the second I handed it to her she sat it on the ground next to her and went back to looking at her phone. It was only when the photographer walked up behind me that she asked me “you want me to open it now?” And I was standing there looking at her the entire time like ??? Yes, when someone hands you a gift you open it.. she opened one thing (not even all the way) and then she said “thanks” and went back on her phone. She made continued remarks about how she knew nothing about what was going on with the wedding which was really frustrating for me because I made it a point to make her feel included and involved, I gave her free reign to plan my bridal shower, my rehearsal dinner, the seating chart, and all signage for the wedding as well as help out with picture frames and helping pay for the cake, she got to see my dress on me before the big day, she went to every meeting we had to plan this day out, and we emailed her an itinerary and timeline of how the day would go, and we texted her to make sure she got it. So her making those remarks felt really annoying to me on a day that’s already so stressful in itself. I decided to let her act that way and pay no mind to it and just do my best to enjoy the day. I was told later that night that she was passing out fireball shooters while walking down the aisle during the ceremony to people on their side only… There’s a lot more but to help this post not be ridiculously long I’m opting to keep that out for now. After the wedding I addressed my husband about how his mom behaved towards me during the day and he noticed this too during the reception, he noticed she didn’t talk to me at all and was wondering why, once he knew all the details he was very upset and concerned for me, he said we would need to figure out how to address this with his parents. We both wanted to wait until after our honeymoon so we did! The conversation with his mother did not go well, my husband tried to take the lead on it and she immediately wanted me to speak on it (I don’t feel it’s my place to address things with his family) but since she was wanting me to I did, and what followed was exactly what I thought she was going to do to me, lying, deflecting, not apologizing, not taking accountability, telling me I’m controlling her son, trying to make me the bad guy, using manipulation tactics to get an emotional response from my husband. It was not a productive conversation so we ended up leaving and just saying thanks for your time. The. Same. Night. I turned off the YouTube video my husband was playing on his phone while he was asleep and closed the app out - it goes to his texts with his mom and they talked about thanks for having the conversation “I love you” and then she ended the conversation with “nobody can ever come between us. I will always love and support you.” - Calling me his WIFE a nobody… My husband has been enmeshed with this toxic family pattern his whole life so I’m trying to be patient and give him time to see, and he’s made huge progress with supporting me and wanting to stand up for me but seeing her say this and him not correcting her over text is my tipping point, I don’t understand why he wouldn’t especially after seeing how nasty and rude his mom was to his wife?!?! If my parents did that to him I would be chewing them out letting them know that behavior is not okay?! So basically I’m thinking about giving him an ultimatum, we continue our marriage with no contact to his mom and dad to protect my own mental health and sanity, or we get an annulment and he can have his mommy… any advice would be greatly appreciated I have no idea how to proceed but this odd behavior from her and rude nasty attitude towards me is not going to be tolerated anymore..", "title": "AITAH for contemplating giving my husband an ultimatum - me or his mom?", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1omdvwe/aitah_for_contemplating_giving_my_husband_an/", "author": "Ready_Software_7538", "score": 9, "subreddit": "AITAH", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:11Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:11.086166"}

TW: suicide I tried writing this post in a way that makes me sound like NTA. But it's really hard not to. So I'm going to not even try. My husband was dating a girl briefly, online around 15-20 years ago. After they broke up, he became best friends and their entire group of 4 girls. They all work in the same industry. They have lived together, partied together, gone through relationships, deaths, tragedies, parties and fun. He has their group name tattooed on his forearm. I met him 4 years ago (2021) during COVID and I was introduced to this circle within a few months. Two of these girls started dating their SOs around the same time. However I never lived in the same city as them, and my (then) boyfriend moved back to their city and their friendship and group size increased. I wanted to move in with him but he said we have to marry first. In 2024 January he proposed to me at his friends house, with their help and with a ring they helped him pick. He didn't invite my friends to this surprise proposal and this became an issue later on. In July 2024, my father attempted suicide and I went through the worst time of life as he battled for his life and continued to struggle with MDD. My fiance was there at the hospital every alternate day. But eventually he bought a ticket to go visit these girls for one of their birthday parties. I was also supposed to go back to another city I was then living in. I really didn't want to leave my parents alone so soon and I begged him to not go to his party either. His explanation was that he's going there for work but he's flying in 4 days early so he can attend his best friends birthday party. His friend hadn't invited me to the party, probably because she assumed I would be in another city then. The 4 girls hadn't really reached out to me much either. In fact, there hadn't been many attempts from their side or my boyfriends side to integrate me in their group. No WhatsApp groups, no hangouts, no surprise party planning (common occurrences in their Circle)....even though they integrated their new boyfriends into the group very well. So that July I called them and asked them whether they can excuse him from this party? They said it's normal and healthy to have friends and to want to spend time with friends and it is his decision to do so. However I know (because he said so) that they can get whiny and manipulate (my words, not his) if one of the 5 is missing from their birthday parties. The whole thing blew up and I ended up saying some mean things to them (you don't need to tell me I'm TAH here). My SO was upset by this but he took my side at that time. In a few days, seeing my boyfriend upset at having missed the party and missing his friends, I messaged them an apology. I blocked them everywhere because I didn't want to hear their nonsense defences of their friendship Circle and how \"healthy friendships\" work either. SO and his girls went back to being friends, hanging out and partying. We both returned to the same city in 2025 and decided to marry. His friends were always invited. One of them also scheduled her wedding for August. SO's dad had a bad accident in March so our wedding got Postponed. We went to SOs best friends wedding even though I had been no contact with them for a year. I prepared a dance performance for the couple, and was generally polite and pleasant with everyone. OBVIOUSLY they made me feel bad in many ways including deliberately (they claim this was not intentional) leaving me out of activities and group photos. The posts on SM also excluded me until I pointed it out to my SO and he pointed it out to them. They apologised to him about all of this BUT NEVER to me directly. My SO obviously gave a toast but he did so standing up with the 3 girls and them all crying and weeping and hugging. He did not mention me in his toast even though he could have mentioned something nice like he proposed to me at their house so our love story has also revolved around the couple etc etc. The other boyfriend who joined the group at the same time was invited to give a toast. Lots of random people were involved and engaged during in various ways but I wasn't. My SO and I came back to our city fighting and bickering I laid down some ground rules. They are invited to the wedding (I paid for their rooms). But they can't be loud and noisy and pushy and drunken like they normally are. (I'm an introvert and the rest of them aren't). I need to be the centre of attention at my wedding (that I'm mostly paying for). The girls won't get assigned any \"wedding duties\" and they won't be included in any special photoshoots. However, I knew the main wedding would stress me out in myriad ways including my own family members. So I asked to have a civil wedding at a courthiuse with just our parents as witnesses. His sisters were invited but couldn't come. I don't have siblings. No friends were invited or expected. My vision for this was a small and sweet moment just for us. And something that would lower the pressure on the main big wedding. His friend/lawyer did the paperwork for us. I got my hair and makeup done early in the morning. Wore a pretty dress. Reached the courthouse, wedding almost didn't happen because of some paperwork issue. We convinced the registrar to marry us. Signed the papers. We walk out of the court to do a photoshoot in the garden with our parents and exchange rings. He said can I call my friends. I said why don't you call your sisters. He said his sisters are busy at work. He videocalled his friends and handed his phone to the lawyer. We exchanged rings and did the photoshoot with the parents ALL THE TIME with his friends cheering noisily in the background. Eventually the lawyer put them on mute. The whole thing was a bit rushed because we weren't actually supposed to be clicking photos in that garden. I don't know if maybe my ground rules weren't clear. Whether he forgot them or found a convenient loophole. Over the course of the day my mood crashed as it sunk in that my one private moment with my husband, my first few moments as his wife ...were hijacked by these 4 girls. Even if it was not clear that friends are not invited, if we were each allowed a videocall I would have liked to call my own friends and grandmother too. Our main wedding is next week but my heart is not in it anymore. All joy and excitement has died now that my worst fears have already come true. His side: he is deeply apologetic. He knows it was a big mistake. He called them \"impulsively\". It wasn't pre-planned with the girls (I asked) - all they wanted was photos and videos from the wedding. He wanted to share this joyous moment with them since we were also there at their court wedding. He loves me and wants a chance to prove that he can be a good husband. He keeps saying he will cut off these girls completely from his life. I thought it might help if the girls apologised to me about how they behaved with me at their wedding as it would help me regain trust in all of them and rebuild bridges. But they refused to apologise and claim it was all unintentional and they really like me etc etc. They think they have tried their best to make amends but \"only because he is their friend.\" They think I have disinvited them but that's not the case. All I asked was that they should write me an apology. The decision to make the attendance conditional on the apology was my husband's. They are telling my husband that they are feeling very upset that he has \"picked his wife's side\" but \"still want to support you because that's what friend's do\".", "title": "AITAH for \"disinviting\" my husband's group of codependent female friends?", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1omdudg/aitah_for_disinviting_my_husbands_group_of/", "author": "lexis5678", "score": 1, "subreddit": "AITAH", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:11Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:11.079141"}

Yesterday, my now-ex and I were sitting at a park after a nice dinner. Out of nowhere she told me that I don’t think she’s intelligent. It felt like she was trying to pick a fight. I told her she’s very emotionally intelligent, which I genuinely meant, but she twisted that into me basically calling her dumb (She then proceeds to do the most unemotionally intelligent thing ever, keep reading). I was startled and said something like “you can’t have it all.” I didn’t mean it in a rude way. I just don’t like feeling pressured to constantly give compliments so she doesn’t get angry. She got really mad and threatened to go home on her own. I convinced her to come with me because I didn’t want her walking alone at night. But once we were in the car, she completely lost control. She was screaming at the top of her lungs like a high-pitched horror-movie kind of scream, crying violently, calling me slurs, and trying to open the car door while I was driving. It was disturbing and it felt unsafe. At one point I snapped and yelled “shut the f\\*\\*k up” because I genuinely didn’t know what else to do. And she actually did. I drove her home, dropped her off, and then I blocked her on everything because the situation was too overwhelming for me. She then used her mom’s phone to call me around 20 times. I ignored it. She texted saying she wanted to tell me “one more important thing,” but I blocked that number too. I’ve decided I’m not engaging anymore. Now I feel empty. Not like normal breakup sadness. More like numbness and confusion. I’m just unsure if cutting her off so abruptly makes me the AH. TLDR: Ex picked a fight, then screamed like a horror movie in the car, tried to open the door while I was driving, and called me slurs. I yelled once, dropped her off, blocked her everywhere for my own safety.

I had to move in with him last year because it was the only way I could afford to study in a university abroad. My parents got divorced in 2020 and he has been living in a different country than the rest of the family ever since then. After my parents divorced I lived primarily with my mum and my brother year round, and then in the holidays/summer my dad would come to visit us or we would go visit him, which basically meant we only ever saw each other in total maybe a couple months per year. Even when my parents were together my dad would have periods of time where he worked outside of the city/country or he was just out all day, this meant that the day to day child raising was primarily done by my mom. When my dad was home he would sometimes get mad at me and yell or hit me, nothing that put my life at risk but it was scary as a child to have a full grown man yell in your face. Now as of last year I started uni and the only way I could afford it was by living with a relative to ease the financial burden of rent and food. Unfortunately I didn’t get in in my home town’s uni so when looking for alternatives my mom suggested I went to live with my dad. I reluctantly agreed because I had no options left but the thing about my father is that he isn’t an easy person to live with, he shows many signs of a narcissistic personality disorder so you have to be very careful about what you say and you always have to agree with him no matter what your personal opinion is because otherwise he gets ticked off. In the past months I can see that he’s been trying to better himself and things aren’t as bad as before. I can tell that he cares about me but I still can’t bring myself to have that unconditional family love that I have for my mom or my brother.

We had an argument yesterday where I was talking about an upcoming autism assessment I’m going to and was talking about possible ADHD symptoms as well after doing a lot of research and watching people’s lived experiences. He offhandedly said that I don’t have ADHD and it rubbed me the wrong way. He asked what was up and I said it felt invalidating. He continued to double down and I have a habit of explaining and reexplaining why I feel a certain way if I’m not heard. He was increasingly interrupting me. As I was saying that it also felt rude and invalidating to be interrupted, he interrupted me again but to apologise. I was quite wound up by this point and I had 3 times said I didn’t want to talk about it anymore right now. After the last interruption, even though it was to apologise, I walked out of the room. I was upset and could feel my body just being overwhelmed. He followed me and told me he was apologising. I couldn’t hear him at this point, grabbed a couple of towels from the hot press and went into the bathroom to have a shower (always helps me calm down). Once he realised I was going to lock the door on him he chased after me and tried to push the door open. We were both pushing the door until the handle broke off in his hand and I managed to lock the door. I had my shower. He knocked a few times, I said I’d be out in a minute, he’d knock again after a few more minutes (I do know I said I’d only be a minute, I was stalling). When I turned off the shower he was still outside telling me to just unlock the door because he wanted to head into town to get replacements. I said I would be out in a few minutes but he kept insisting that I do it now. He threatened to knock down the door if I didn’t open it. I dried up and got dressed. When I exited the room, the conversation continued. Still kind of heated. I gave out to him for breaking the door, he argued back that we broke the door. Argument got really heated again. He was saying that he just wanted to have an easy day and this could have been a small thing. I broke down a bit after he said he was sorry for being invalidating and I couldn’t figure out why he couldn’t have just said that, that’s it, that was all that was needed. He apologised for his side. He went out, got the door handle and came back pissed off. I didn’t feel like I did anything wrong, I was trying to be clear but he then said he wouldn’t talk about it anymore if I didn’t apologise. I was worked up and pissed to be honest. We did start it up again, both of us interrupting each other, and he told me that he doesn’t feel he can tell me his feelings in the moment because I’ll turn it around on him but that it was a mistake to do that because now I think I’m always right. I don’t think this is true. Ish. When he tries to talk to me it can be quite blaming and I’ll admit my back gets up. The issues I’m having are some statements he made in this whole thing. I used a lot of ‘I’ statements in this argument and he said I’m always turning it back to myself, that I’m self centred and a narcissist like my mother. At one point he said I wasn’t worth it and only later clarified that he meant to talk to. At the end he said the reason he interrupts me so much is because I never shut the fuck up. He said this makes him feel like a child being talked down to. I do explain a lot, especially seeing the length of this post. I don’t feel like I can get my point out though without the nuance. At one point it got quiet and he asked if I had anything else I had anything else I wanted to say and I said I wasn’t a narcissist. I said this 2 times before he said it wasn’t good to say but if the person he’s talking to is interrupting and not listening the. It’s not unfair to say it. Then he said he couldn’t believe I brought it back to myself, that he was expecting acknowledgment for not being perfect in that argument. Anyway, just a long rant. Helped to type it out. I’m feeling very disconnected from him.

My four best friends ruth, Bella, joanne, katy and i (fake names) have been talking about forming a band for over two years. And early this year, we decided to finally make it happen! I'm the singer, joanne and bella are guitarists, katy is the drummer and ruth is the bassist. A bit of backstory - Joanne and Bella have been best friends since they were like 5, and they're always together. Although lately there has been some tension between them, and we al kind of unanimously agreed bella was at fault. Joanne told me that the pair had gotten over it, but the others and i aren't so sure. Bella had also been really mean to me and one of my other friends earlier this year, so bad that i convinced my parents to move me schools (which i'm finally doing yayyyy!). Over the past couple months, bella's attitude towards us has gotten better, but everyso often their are snarky remarks and its really not fun. anyway, back to the main point. Most sundays at 3:00pm, we meet up at Katy's house for practice, although sometimes we can't because katy will have someone over or something. Bella lives 2 mins away, and Joanne and ruth live about 7 mins away from katy. With the normal traffic, i live about 25 mins away. when we schedual rehersals, its always at 3:00 on sunday, but we often schedule them about 20 minuets to an hour before they would start. I never really have time to check my phone on sunday afternoon, because i have sport and other pre-occupants. Because of this, and the fact that my friends schedule them about an hour before they start, i'm often 5 mins late (roughly). Bella has recenlty been pretty passive agressive about me not showing up on time, and i wanted to explain to her that i felt bad for my mum because she has to drive almost two hours to get me there and back. I also show up late sometimes because of my home situation, but i wont get into that. it's gotten to the point of bella's agressiveness that i've been thinking about skipping one or two to get my point across (i would obviously text them first that i couldnt make it, i wouldnt just blow them off). I know if i did this, most of them would get pretty annoyed, and bella would go ballistic on monday at school, but i dont want to put up with the nagging anymore. I've never missed a rehersal over the 6 months we've been doing this. idk. AITAH for not wanting to go?? EDIT: i have asked bella to like be more respectful to me when she isnt (even when its not in the band situation), but when i did/do she said \"oh i didn't think it would be that big of a deal\" or smth similar. also, the rest of the band is normally really respectful, and bella can be really nice at times too. but yeah", "title": "AITAH for not wanting to show up to my band rehersal?", "source": "reddit_post", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1omcy5h/aitah_for_not_wanting_to_show_up_to_my_band/", "author": "Regular-Try-6700", "score": 3, "subreddit": "AITAH", "timestamp": "2025-11-02T12:16:11Z", "cleaned_at": "2025-11-02T20:16:11.037146"}

Just as the title says, I destroyed my minecraft world because my FIL took over. For context, my fiance and I are huge gamers but ever since having our second child there is no time for it. I have no time for myself at all actually. About a month postpartum my fiance made me a minecraft realm so that I at least had that to play and it helped me relax and focus on something fun since I had next to no time for myself. I played while I nursed my baby, I played while everyone was asleep. Pretty much every spare chance I got, I played as a way to relax. Well we invited my FIL to play with us and within a MONTH he took over completely. Every time I got on whatever project I was working on was taken over. Or he would ridicule the project I was working on as a waste of time while doing dumb shit too. Like its a game, whatever I choose to do to relax shouldn't matter on here right? After a while every single time I got on my rooms were rearranged, my chests were moved to an entire different building and my gardens were moved. Then he built a ton of buildings and trading posts in my \"backyard\" and blocked all of my gates or anything I was using. NONE of my fiance's stuff gets messed with, only mine. His excuse is \"your a woman, you should like it organized the way I have it\" The last time I got on he bragged about staying up for days to strip mine the world. \"Yeah it'll take you a good 20 minutes of travel to find any kind of good mining material, I mined it all out\" meanwhile he kept saying how it was annoying to do this all twice because he already did and built all of this on his own world. I could have stuck up for myself better but I was trying not to be overly emotional but now even six months later if my man asks me to play I just can't. It was so disrespectful and out of touch. If I build a new world I would have to put another 40 hours of playtime to rebuild what I had. I have kids, it's not that easy and I shouldn't have had to anyway. Well my fiance asked me if I wanted to play yesterday and I got on only to remember i'm not going to be able to find any of my stuff and all of my rooms had been moved. So I took about a hundred water buckets and made FIL's castle an aquarium, completely dismantled his entire farm and broke all of his chests letting all of the shit he collected sit and disappear. I figure since i'm not allowed having anything where I want it why the hell should he? Now both of our time has been wasted. Petty, i know. AITAH?

A few details. I'm 35f and I have a lot of younger sibling, 4 from my mum side and 2 from my dad. I found out about the 2 from my dad just a few years back. So, When I was 6y old me, my mum, \"dad\" and brother moved to my \"dad's\" county. Note that \"dad\" is not my DAD but my step father. I found out when I was about 10yold but didn't make any fus About it, thinking that my mum would eventually talk to me about it, surprise surprise, she didn't. Still being fold that my stepdad is my dad, even do she knows I now. All these years I was there for her. I was her maid, baby site etc. I stoped my education because of here when she was sick to care for here and my younger siblings. I eventually meet my now husband and she got terrible mad. There were terrible fights where she said a lot of things to me and I eventually stoped talking to here and moved out a year and a half later. We started speaking again when we got engaged and stated planning the wedding. I didn't mention that I found my father and that I'm in contact with him. Fast forward 10y (a lot of things happen till know) I now have two kids, my brother has a kid, my sister prego and we all live our lives. My \"father\" help a little bit with buying our apartment,but not as much as he help my brother and sister. I'm not mad about it, because I'm not his daughter,but a little sad. I was always visible treated differently and now that I'm older i remember all these little things and miss treatment,the fits and yealing. My brother practicele got his house half price and my sister got her house half paid of. They both have sons and I have daughters and see the difference in treatment there to. This year I started therapy because I was really depressed and breaking point was Ester where I stoped communicating with my mum. A few months after she sends me a text asking what's the problem, where I stupid told here a few things, nothing to insult just that I'm not god,that I can't listen to the fights anymore. I got a 10min voice message from here that I'm ungrateful,she is not guilty for my depression,that I insulted her, we are family you don't treat family that way, that's just how we are and I can lovem that way or not, etc. I didn't answer and we are since on no contact. Its been 4m. In the meantime I meet my dada and siblings. The few hours we spent together were bliss and joyfull and they made me feel like family, the way I never fealt at home I wanted to talk to my mum,but she is acting like a child and I don't have the energy to deal with her.

I will write a thread here to give you 24hours of period after holiday with my 39year old partner and 6 year old daughter. AITAH in all these because he is playing victim and being tribal when I sent him all his doings instead of being understanding. 1- We came back from holiday with terrible food poisoning as a family. I couldn't get out of the bed for one day, next day I was on my foot. He invited friends over knowing that I will do the preparation for cleaning and food! He said he will order pizza and I rejected as our situation is fragile. I said I would cook something healthy even though it's hard, but his response was \"I WANT PIZZA, IF YOU DONT WANT DONT EAT\" like I am thinking only myself, not my daughter or him. Subsequently, my daughter got sick at night after eating pizza and I had to stay with her since 2am... 2- During preparation for guests, I did all washing clothes, cleaning including toilets as we were sick and I didn't want to spread any virus in case. I cooked broth with Vegatable and he rushed down and turned off the job saying I am killing all the vegetables in high heat. Like I am not sick, and like I am not still doing errands to keep us steady, killed vegetables are out problem. While I was doing all these errands, he was sitting on his couch playing games and giving 2 hour of bathroom break. When I asked how he doesn't care I am doing all this by myself, he said he is tired and feels like relaxing today , just like I don't have that privilege at all... 3- In 12 years relationship, unless I told him, if he sees folded clothes he wouldn't take them upstairs, let aside placing them. And when I told him all those, I need to say it in a very kind tone or he wouldn't do. He unloads dishwasher every morning, and dropping of the kid to school , and thinks all he can contribute while I am working, being mum, cleaner whatever I need to do on that day. 4- He constantly watches porn which I caught many times, which puts me off from sex. And because he is rejected ,now he has all kinds of eye contacts with other women outside who shows any kind of interest to him. I know this will not stop here. And when I told him all these he plays the victim and being tribal, he just says it's not easy to be rejected always and not trying to correct the root cause even if I clearly ask him to correct... We have a 6 year old and I am so stuck in this situation , and don't know what to do? No therapy or whatsoever helped so far. AITAH here or am I losing?", "title": "AITAH in all of this??

My husband (37M) and I (30F) have a 5-month-old daughter who’s being baptized this weekend. I’m exclusively breastfeeding, and 3 months ago we figured out she has an intolerance to dairy and gluten — so my diet is super restricted right now. It’s been really tough, but obviously worth it for her. This morning, my mother-in-law texted us saying she’s picking up “some delicious pastries” for the reception. She’s been told multiple times that I can’t eat things like that right now, and we’ve told her we are all set with the refreshments for the reception. It ticks me off when she ignores us, and it feels inconsiderate that she is going to be bringing even more delicious things for others to enjoy ‘in my face’ so to speak. (I already can’t have the cake she is bringing. She also knows, or should know my husband doesn’t eat those things either) In a moment of frustration, I replied to her text: “I can’t eat any of that stuff, but suit yourself.” She responded that it’s for the guests, but I wouldn’t bring items as a guest to the home of a friend or family member that they can’t enjoy. It feels like she’s doing it more for herself than for us, or overstepping her role in the reception. My husband was upset with me. He said I was being “cold and mean” and that I should’ve just thanked her or ignored it instead of being snarky. He also told me I shouldn’t say things like that to his mom — ever — even when she upsets me. From my perspective, I was polite enough given the situation. I didn’t curse or insult her, I just stated a fact and set a boundary. I’m exhausted, hormonal, and honestly tired of feeling like I have to tiptoe around her feelings while mine don’t matter.

It’s kind of a tradition. This year, I texted my mom asking if we were going, and she said “No, they changed the format and we’re not going.” Something about that felt off, so I asked again and she doubled down and said they weren’t going. I texted my sister and said I don’t want to be lied to and I won’t be mad but was my family not invited this year. She said it wasn’t a family event, but she went with some friends. I called my older sister and she said their family didn’t go because her father in law was in the hospital and it’s been a really hard week for their family. Two weeks later the event posted a picture from the event and my family was very clearly in the background. So they were there. I confronted my mom calmly. I said, “I’m confused, you said it wasn’t happening, but I saw pictures from it. I’m not upset about not being invited, I’m hurt that I was lied to.” She sent a voice message basically saying, “We didn’t think you liked that event, so we didn’t invite you. We didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.” No actual apology. Then I called and had both my parents on speaker. My dad said, “She said sorry and we’re done here.” When I said she never actually said sorry, he accused me of “setting them up” because I “knew” they went. (I didn’t.) Then he said, “As far as we’re concerned, this is over.” No accountability at all. Now my dad’s throwing my mom a 70th birthday party in a few weeks, and I honestly don’t see how I can go.

Frequently Asked Questions    Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction Table Based on meticulous analysis and market trends, the table below outlines the average prices for TON from 2024 to 2050:  What Is Toncoin (TON)? Toncoin is a cryptocurrency functioning within a multichain project, is engineered for swift transactions and is supported by the open TON community. Initially conceived by the Durov brothers in 2018 for rapid transactions, Toncoin has expanded into a versatile platform accommodating various applications, from noncustodial wallets to decentralized exchanges and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With its proprietary TON wallet, users can execute prompt and secure blockchain-based payments without intermediaries. It operates within the Open Network blockchain, employing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model to ensure scalability and security for potentially millions of users. Will Toncoin Go Past All-Time Highs?&nbsp; With the TON all-time high recorded at $7.65 on Apr. 11, 2024 and the current price at $6.39, investors are curious about its potential to surpass previous highs. CertiK&#8217;s recognition of the Toncoin blockchain as the world&#8217;s fastest network further enhances TON prospects, outpacing renowned blockchains like Solana and Polygon. This achievement underscores the network&#8217;s robustness, hinting at potential price gains. Considering TON’s positive momentum, a high percentage of profitable holders, and its unparalleled network speed, there appears to be room for growth based on both pattern and market sentiment. However, it&#8217;s essential to remain vigilant of potential selling pressure, especially if it coincides with any weakening of the current uptrend signals identified through technical analysis. By closely monitoring these factors, investors can better gauge TON’s trajectory and assess its potential to surpass all-time highs. Will Toncoin Reach $10? TON’s trajectory toward reaching $10 is influenced by several key factors, including its recent performance and market dynamics. Over the past 30 days, TON has displayed a upward trend, experiencing a surge of 5.35%. This surge can be attributed to significant developments, such as Binance&#8217;s introduction of perpetual futures trading for the TON token, amplifying investor interest and driving up its value.&nbsp; Telegram Messenger&#8217;s decision to compensate channel owners with cryptocurrency has added to the momentum, fostering a positive outlook for Toncoin&#8217;s future. With such momentum, the outlook for TON price is optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential climb to $9.22 by the end of the month, representing a substantial 44.29% increase from its current price. In the mid-term, investors are bullish and optimistic that the recent progress in the project and overall boom structure in the market will lead the project to $10 on the second quarter of this year. Despite the promising trajectory, it&#8217;s essential to approach price predictions with caution, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While TON’s recent performance and positive news may fuel optimism, investors should conduct thorough market analysis and adhere to sound investment strategies to navigate uncertainties and fluctuations effectively. Toncoin Price History and Market Position Over its history, TON has demonstrated a robust performance in the cryptocurrency market. With an all-time high of $7.65 recorded on Apr. 11, 2024, and a current price of $6.39, TON has exhibited substantial growth potential. The cryptocurrency experienced an all-time low of $0.3906 on Sept. 20, 2021, demonstrating significant volatility over time. Presently, TON holds a market cap of $22.28 billion, ranking it No. 9 in terms of market capitalization. The circulating supply stands at 3,474,564,734 TON, with a total supply of 5,106,856,086 TON. The fully diluted market cap is estimated at $32.7 billion. Analyzing TON historical price trends shows a clear indication of an upward trajectory, with recent forecasts suggesting a potential surge to $8.18 and even $10 by the end of 2024. Toncoin operates in a competitive landscape, facing rivalry from decentralized layer-1 blockchains and cryptocurrencies offering similar features. Competitors such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) pose significant challenges, focusing on scalability, decentralized applications and smart contracts. Despite the competition, TON’s current market position, price performance and trading volume signal optimism for its future growth. The recent surge in trading volume, coupled with high profitability among holders and positive technical analysis signals, indicates potential for continued upward momentum. Investors are advised to monitor market trends and competitor activities closely to capitalize on TON’s growth potential in the cryptocurrency market.

According to its projections, TON is poised for a bullish trajectory, with an anticipated average price surge to $22.51 by the end of 2026. Digital Coin Price also predicts a notable escalation to $47.95 by the end of 2030, indicating substantial growth potential for TON in the long run.

Bearish Long-Term Price Prediction for Toncoin Despite numerous optimistic projections, there are also some bearish long-term price predictions for TON. TradingBeasts, a well-regarded forecast platform, foresees TON&#8217;s price hovering around $2.36 by 2026, implying a potential return on investment (ROI) of negative 64%. TradingBeasts also anticipates TON&#8217;s value to reach $3.87 by the end of 2027.

A team of seasoned analysts with expertise in cryptocurrency market dynamics backs its predictions.

Frequently Asked Questions    Toncoin (TON) Price Prediction Table Based on meticulous analysis and market trends, the table below outlines the average prices for TON from 2024 to 2050:  What Is Toncoin (TON)? Toncoin is a cryptocurrency functioning within a multichain project, is engineered for swift transactions and is supported by the open TON community. Initially conceived by the Durov brothers in 2018 for rapid transactions, Toncoin has expanded into a versatile platform accommodating various applications, from noncustodial wallets to decentralized exchanges and non-fungible tokens (NFTs). With its proprietary TON wallet, users can execute prompt and secure blockchain-based payments without intermediaries. It operates within the Open Network blockchain, employing the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus model to ensure scalability and security for potentially millions of users. Will Toncoin Go Past All-Time Highs?&nbsp; With the TON all-time high recorded at $7.65 on Apr. 11, 2024 and the current price at $6.39, investors are curious about its potential to surpass previous highs. CertiK&#8217;s recognition of the Toncoin blockchain as the world&#8217;s fastest network further enhances TON prospects, outpacing renowned blockchains like Solana and Polygon. This achievement underscores the network&#8217;s robustness, hinting at potential price gains. Considering TON’s positive momentum, a high percentage of profitable holders, and its unparalleled network speed, there appears to be room for growth based on both pattern and market sentiment. However, it&#8217;s essential to remain vigilant of potential selling pressure, especially if it coincides with any weakening of the current uptrend signals identified through technical analysis. By closely monitoring these factors, investors can better gauge TON’s trajectory and assess its potential to surpass all-time highs. Will Toncoin Reach $10? TON’s trajectory toward reaching $10 is influenced by several key factors, including its recent performance and market dynamics. Over the past 30 days, TON has displayed a upward trend, experiencing a surge of 5.35%. This surge can be attributed to significant developments, such as Binance&#8217;s introduction of perpetual futures trading for the TON token, amplifying investor interest and driving up its value.&nbsp; Telegram Messenger&#8217;s decision to compensate channel owners with cryptocurrency has added to the momentum, fostering a positive outlook for Toncoin&#8217;s future. With such momentum, the outlook for TON price is optimistic, with analysts predicting a potential climb to $9.22 by the end of the month, representing a substantial 44.29% increase from its current price. In the mid-term, investors are bullish and optimistic that the recent progress in the project and overall boom structure in the market will lead the project to $10 on the second quarter of this year. Despite the promising trajectory, it&#8217;s essential to approach price predictions with caution, given the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. While TON’s recent performance and positive news may fuel optimism, investors should conduct thorough market analysis and adhere to sound investment strategies to navigate uncertainties and fluctuations effectively. Toncoin Price History and Market Position Over its history, TON has demonstrated a robust performance in the cryptocurrency market. With an all-time high of $7.65 recorded on Apr. 11, 2024, and a current price of $6.39, TON has exhibited substantial growth potential. The cryptocurrency experienced an all-time low of $0.3906 on Sept. 20, 2021, demonstrating significant volatility over time. Presently, TON holds a market cap of $22.28 billion, ranking it No. 9 in terms of market capitalization. The circulating supply stands at 3,474,564,734 TON, with a total supply of 5,106,856,086 TON. The fully diluted market cap is estimated at $32.7 billion. Analyzing TON historical price trends shows a clear indication of an upward trajectory, with recent forecasts suggesting a potential surge to $8.18 and even $10 by the end of 2024. Toncoin operates in a competitive landscape, facing rivalry from decentralized layer-1 blockchains and cryptocurrencies offering similar features. Competitors such as Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA) and Avalanche (AVAX) pose significant challenges, focusing on scalability, decentralized applications and smart contracts. Despite the competition, TON’s current market position, price performance and trading volume signal optimism for its future growth.

While rooted in meme culture, Myro distinguishes itself by leveraging the Solana blockchain’s capabilities and fostering community engagement.&nbsp; Beyond its playful origins, Myro aims to provide practical utility through exclusive merchandise, event access and innovative tools like the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App to bridge the gap between meme-driven hype and real-world application.&nbsp;       Table of contents [Show]     2025 Myro Price Prediction   2026 Myro Price Prediction   2030 Myro Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Myro   Factors That Could Slow Myro&#8217;s Growth   Price Predictions from Analysts   Market Sentiment and Social Trends   Speculative Demand and Hype Cycles   Broader Market Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 Myro Price Prediction  Technical indicators reflect a bearish sentiment and the Fear &amp; Greed Index has an Extreme Fear reading of 25.  Despite the long-term price prediction, CoinCodex’s analysis suggests that purchasing Myro now may not be advisable. 2026 Myro Price Prediction  For 2026, February is predicted to be the most bullish month, potentially seeing a 178.43% price increase from its current value.  2030 Myro Price Prediction  By 2030, Myro is projected to grow substantially, with the forecast implying a potential return on investment of 353.67%, reflecting a strongly bullish sentiment for the year. Reasons to Invest in Myro Myro’s integration with the Solana blockchain, its community-driven nature and the possibility of high returns associated with meme coin volatility are among the reasons to invest in it. Investors should consider:  Solana Blockchain Integration: Myro’s foundation on the Solana blockchain provides potential advantages in terms of transaction speed and efficiency. Solana’s high throughput and low fees contribute to Myro’s usability and appeal.&nbsp; Utility and Development: The project’s efforts to develop practical utilities such as the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App could move the token beyond meme status. If these features gain traction, they could add real-world value to it.&nbsp; Potential for High Returns: The cryptocurrency market is known for its volatility and meme coins in particular can experience significant price swings. While investing in meme coins is risky, it is also possible to see substantial returns for those who time their investments well.&nbsp;  Factors That Could Slow Myro’s Growth Because it’s a meme coin, Myro is volatile with values heavily influenced by fleeting hype and speculative trends. If the initial enthusiasm declines or if negative sentiment takes hold, Myro’s price could experience a sharp decline. The perception of meme coins as purely speculative assets could deter serious long-term investors and limit sustained growth. Myro’s dependence on the Solana blockchain also makes it vulnerable – any issues affecting the Solana network, such as outages or security breaches, could impact Myro’s performance. Although the project is trying to transcend its meme status through initiatives like the MYRO Buy Bot and Social-Fi Mobile App, the success of the features is uncertain. If Myro fails to deliver on these promises or there is not sustained user engagement, its growth could be hindered. Price Predictions from Analysts According to CoinCodex, Myro’s price history reveals a significant range, reaching its all-time high of $0.445979 on March 9, 2024, after hitting an all-time low of $0.002125 on Nov. 14, 2023. Since its peak, Myro’s lowest price point was $0.010249 (cycle low) and its highest price since that low was $0.013344 (cycle high). The Myro price prediction is bearish with the Fear &amp; Greed Index indicating a level of fear at 43.&nbsp; Myro’s circulating supply is 944.2 million MYRO out of a maximum supply of 1 billion MYRO. Regarding market capitalization, Myro has notable positions in the Solana ecosystem, ranking No. 12 in the Solana Network sector, No. 96 in the Meme Coins sector and No. 58 in the broader Solana Coins &amp; Tokens sector.&nbsp; Market Sentiment and Social Trends According to Coinbase (as of April 11), MYRO generated moderate social media discussion, with 423 unique individuals contributing to online conversations, placing it at No. 165 regarding overall mentions and activities. News coverage of Myro has declined, with zero recent news articles published. On X, sentiment leans toward neutrality with 89.61% of posts expressing a neutral stance. Bullish sentiment accounts for 10.39% of posts while bearish sentiment represents only 0.73% based on a sample of 915 posts. Reddit posts tended to have more downvotes than upvotes while comments tended to receive more upvotes than downvotes. Speculative Demand and Hype Cycles Like many meme coins, Myro experiences significant price fluctuations driven by speculative demand and hype cycles which are characterized by rapid price surges fueled by social media buzz, influencer endorsements and the fear of missing out. A surge of interest can attract more investors and drive the price higher. Still, the rallies are often unsustainable because they are not usually based on fundamental value or long-term utility.&nbsp; As hype subsides, speculative demand declines leading to sharp price corrections. This volatility makes Myro a high-risk investment where timing is crucial. Investors who capitalize on hype cycles should know the potential for substantial losses because the market can shift abruptly.&nbsp; Broader Market Factors MYRO’s price movements are also influenced by broader macroeconomic conditions including Bitcoin and Ethereum’s performance, Federal Reserve policies and overall risk appetite in the crypto market. Historically, meme coins have closely followed Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory, so MYRO will likely see a speculative interest surge if BTC enters a bull market. Conversely, meme coins suffer heavier losses than more fundamentally driven assets during bearish market conditions.

Feeling confident about this CAKE price prediction? You can trade PancakeSwap on Coinbase—and if you&#8217;re new to the platform, you could earn up to $400 in rewards by completing a few quick educational lessons and making your first qualifying trade. PancakeSwap (CAKE) has long been the go-to decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, offering cheap trades, yield farming and sweet, sweet staking rewards. But while it used to dominate the DeFi leaderboard, today’s landscape is a bit less syrupy. With token emissions outpacing demand and competition heating up across L2s and altchains, CAKE’s future isn’t as cut and dry. Still, PancakeSwap is far from irrelevant. The platform continues to burn CAKE tokens, upgrade its features and remain a low-fee favorite. But the real question is whether this DEX token can reclaim its former glory or if it’ll slowly get flipped by faster, flashier competitors.       Table of contents [Show]     2025 CAKE Price Prediction   2026 CAKE Price Prediction   2030 CAKE Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in PancakeSwap (CAKE)   Factors That Could Slow PancakeSwap&#8217;s Growth   Price Prediction Methodology   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends &amp; Ecosystem Analysis   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 CAKE Price Prediction  CAKE could see moderate bullish momentum in 2025. While it’s not moon-bound, the projection assumes a recovery in DEX trading volumes and DeFi user activity. If market confidence in Binance Smart Chain returns (despite Ethereum L2s eating its lunch), PancakeSwap may reestablish itself as a reliable low-fee alternative. This isn’t about hype, this is about resilience in a maturing DeFi space. The high-end estimate assumes increased staking participation, solid token burns offsetting emissions and broader BSC ecosystem growth. But it’s a tightrope walk. And one misstep (like fewer incentives or BNB ecosystem weakness) and CAKE could lose heat fast. 2026 CAKE Price Prediction  In 2026, CAKE may slide into consolidation mode. The muted outlook likely reflects market fatigue and the emergence of stronger DEX players on Ethereum rollups and modular chains. As DeFi infrastructure evolves, users demand more than swaps and syrup pools. They want real interoperability, advanced order routing and token utility that doesn’t rely solely on inflationary rewards. If PancakeSwap can adapt by integrating cross-chain functionality, launching unique DeFi tools or improving CAKE’s governance power, it may still outperform some legacy tokens. But without those upgrades, it risks becoming a second-tier player with limited upside. 2030 CAKE Price Prediction  By 2030, long-term forecasts take a bullish turn. Reasons to Invest in PancakeSwap (CAKE) For all its challenges, PancakeSwap remains one of the largest DEXs in crypto by user count and total value locked on BSC. That matters. A loyal base still farming rewards, swapping tokens and engaging with the protocol daily. CAKE also benefits from a few enduring advantages:  Low transaction fees thanks to BSC’s infrastructure Frequent token burns aimed at curbing inflation A well-known brand and user-friendly UI Continuous updates including prediction markets, gaming integrations and new staking options  For investors looking to bet on established DeFi platforms rather than risky, unproven alternatives, CAKE might still be a compelling choice especially at a discount. Factors That Could Slow PancakeSwap’s Growth CAKE’s tokenomics are a double-edged sword. While the project regularly burns a decent chunk of supply, its emissions remain high and rewards are still the primary driver of demand. That’s a tough game to win long-term. Other red flags include:  Declining BNB chain usage compared to Ethereum L2s Minimal differentiation in a crowded DEX market Risk of regulatory pressure on incentive-based platforms User migration to newer protocols offering better returns  Unless PancakeSwap seriously levels its value proposition beyond token swaps and yield farming, CAKE may slowly lose relevance to smarter, faster competitors. And if DeFi continues consolidating around a handful of ecosystems, BSC’s dominance could shrink, taking PancakeSwap with it. Price Prediction Methodology Our CAKE price forecast through 2030 combines multiple research angles to create a balanced view of its potential. Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We aggregated price predictions from trusted platforms like WalletInvestor, CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice. These forecasts provided the low, average and high estimates used in each year’s section. Market Trends &amp; Ecosystem Analysis We analyzed on-chain metrics such as user growth, total value locked and DEX trading volume across the Binance ecosystem. These data points influenced our understanding of PancakeSwap’s current standing and future outlook. Macroeconomic Factors Like all altcoins, CAKE is at the mercy of macro market conditions. Rising interest rates, tightening regulations or waning investor appetite for risk assets could hurt CAKE’s performance regardless of what’s happening on-chain. Conversely, a renewed bull market or a DeFi resurgence could breathe new life into the token.

The platform’s ability to handle high transaction volumes efficiently makes it attractive for applications like digital asset management and secure financial transactions.&nbsp; Algorand has pursued partnerships to expand its ecosystem and real-world applications. Collaborations with technology companies, government entities and financial institutions are key to its growth. Partnerships aimed at developing Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) and tokenizing real-world assets bring credibility and utility to the Algorand network.&nbsp; Factors That Could Slow Algorand’s Growth Alogrand growth trajectory faces headwinds from intense competition in the blockchain space where established and emerging platforms compete for dominance. Regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies, particularly among institutional investors, could impede adoption.&nbsp; While Algorand targets institutional integration, progress is slow in this area because of concerns about security, scalability and compliance. Its less developed developer ecosystem compared to more mature platforms could also hinder the creation of dApps and use cases.&nbsp; The volatility of the cryptocurrency market can deter potential investors and users. Unforeseen technological hurdles or security vulnerabilities also could damage Alogrand’s reputation.&nbsp; Price Prediction Methodology Aggregate Analyst Forecasts To estimate Polygon’s future price, we aggregated predictions from several sources:  Wallet Investor CoinCodex Changelly CoinPedia  These forecasts factor in historical price movements, technical analysis and broader market sentiment. Given ALGO’s speculative nature, predictions vary widely, ranging from bearish estimates suggesting declines in a risk-averse market to optimistic projections anticipating new highs in a bullish cycle. Market Trends Sentiment and Social Trends Market sentiment for Algorand leans bearish, with 71% of indicators suggesting a downward trend. The Fear &amp; Greed Index registers a score of 32, indicating a state of fear among investors, according to Changelly.com. Short-term charts (four-hour and daily) show a weakening trend, with falling 50-day moving averages potentially resisting future price movements.&nbsp; The weekly timeframe presents a potentially bullish perspective. Although the 50-day moving average is above the price and rising, potentially acting as resistance, the 200-day moving average, while declining, could signal the potential for a longer-term trend reversal. This suggests that while short-term caution is warranted, there may be opportunities for a bullish reversal in the longer term.&nbsp; Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic factors play a role in shaping the landscape for cryptocurrencies like Algorand. Federal Reserve policies, particularly adjustments to interest rates, can significantly impact investor sentiment and capital flow. Increases in interest rates tend to tighten financial conditions, reducing the availability of capital for riskier assets like cryptocurrencies potentially leading to downward price pressure on ALGO. Decreases in interest rates can stimulate investment, potentially driving up ALGO’s value.&nbsp; The overall health of the global economy also influences investor behavior during economic ALGO. If traditional markets like equities and commodities experience significant declines, ALGO and other digital assets will likely follow suit.    Frequently Asked Questions     Q   How much will Algorand be worth in 2030?    1 How much will Algorand be worth in 2030?  asked 2025-11-01  Margaret Jackson    A   1 By 2030, Algorand (ALGO) is expected to trade between $0.093 (bearish) and $0.127 (bullish), with an average price prediction of $0.108. Despite market volatility, long-term projections indicate a potential 22.51% ROI, driven by Algorand’s focus on institutional adoption and real-world asset tokenization.

Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) is the black sheep of the blockchain world, and that’s by design. It doesn’t use a traditional blockchain. Instead, it runs on a patented data structure called a hashgraph, which claims to be faster, more secure and infinitely more efficient. It’s not trying to beat Ethereum at its own game. It’s trying to rewrite the whole playbook. Built for enterprise-scale adoption and governed by a council of global corporations like Google, IBM and LG, Hedera is going after the suit-and-tie crowd. Think less DAO and more Fortune 500. If it works, HBAR could be the infrastructure layer that powers everything from digital ID systems to carbon offset marketplaces to tokenized assets for mega-corps. But that strategy comes with trade-offs. Permissioned council governance, sluggish retail adoption and a utility model that’s still proving itself make HBAR one of the most polarizing assets in crypto.

Hedera has signed deals with supply chain platforms, stablecoin issuers and carbon markets and these could begin to translate into meaningful on-chain volume. Still, the market is clearly waiting for more proof. Retail adoption remains thin and most users couldn’t name a dApp running on Hedera if their lives depended on it. The upper-end forecast of assumes a successful rollout of key use cases and a few splashy partnerships. But unless Hedera starts generating real transaction demand that translates to consistent network usage, price gains could stay stuck in neutral. 2026 HBAR Price Prediction  Things could get rougher in 2026. If Hedera fails to convert more enterprise pilots into real-world applications with visible metrics and adoption, HBAR’s utility could remain underwhelming. Hedera has all the paperwork and partnerships in place, but what it needs now is users, consumers, developers and enterprises pushing actual volume. Without that, HBAR risks becoming a case study in great tech with nowhere to go. That said, the ceiling in the forecast still leaves room for a rebound. Hedera could re-emerge as a sleeper play if macro conditions turn bullish and enterprise integrations scale.  2030 HBAR Price Prediction  If enterprises continue to use the network through prepaid accounts or private integrations that don’t actually touch HBAR on-chain, there’s a hard ceiling on demand. The token becomes more of a back end utility chip than a value-accruing asset. The low-end forecast of reflects a scenario including stalled adoption, council stagnation and a shrinking retail investor base.  Reasons to Invest in Hedera Hashgraph (HBAR) Hedera still offers a differentiated value proposition. Its underlying hashgraph consensus is fast, low-latency and incredibly scalable compared to traditional blockchains. It avoids forks, handles thousands of transactions per second and finalizes in seconds. That’s not nothing. It also has one of the most credible governance structures in crypto. The Hedera Governing Council includes some of the world’s largest and most recognizable companies, which adds legitimacy and stability to the protocol. Hedera may be one of their first stops if enterprises ever go all in on decentralized tech. HBAR is also carbon-negative, with built-in tools to support ESG-focused applications, which may play well in a more regulation-heavy, climate-conscious future. Factors That Could Slow Hedera’s Growth Let’s cut through the PR gloss: Hedera has yet to prove its tech advantage translates into market leadership. There’s little evidence of robust organic growth from builders or users for all the corporate logos and press releases. Its enterprise-first strategy is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it’s unique. On the other, it’s slow, bureaucratic and less transparent than ecosystems where usage is visible and on-chain. If adoption doesn’t show up in the form of HBAR demand, investors may have difficulty staying interested. Then there’s the tokenomics. Hedera’s total supply is large and the release schedule is long. If use cases don’t catch up to supply emissions, price pressure could intensify especially in bear markets. And as more modular and interoperable L1s emerge, Hedera could find itself boxed out of the most dynamic parts of Web3. Price Prediction Methodology Our HBAR forecast blends multiple layers of research to provide a grounded, realistic view through 2030. Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We compiled price predictions from respected crypto platforms including WalletInvestor, CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice. These provide each forecasted year&#8217;s low, average and high estimates. Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis Hedera is focused on enterprise blockchain infrastructure. Our analysis weighed current integrations, partnerships and ecosystem updates to assess whether HBAR usage will likely grow or stagnate. Macroeconomic Factors HBAR is highly sensitive to institutional sentiment and the regulatory climate. If enterprise blockchain gets regulatory tail winds or tax incentives, Hedera could gain traction.

Its unique governance model – led by a council of global corporations like Google, IBM and LG – also sets it apart from community-driven blockchains.

Arweave (AR) is betting big on one of the most overlooked but crucial components of decentralized infrastructure: permanent data storage. Unlike traditional cloud services or even Web3 file systems like IPFS, Arweave goes all in on the promise of storing data forever.&nbsp; The protocol incentivizes a global network of storage providers using a unique endowment mechanism that frontloads the storage cost for long-term sustainability. It’s a bold approach that challenges centralized data hoarders like AWS, Dropbox and Google Cloud. If decentralization is about freedom and permanence, Arweave may be one of the few walking that talk. As AI and blockchain generate mountains of data daily, the need for immutable, tamperproof, long-term storage is only growing. The question is, will Arweave become the vault of the decentralized web or just another ambitious idea buried in digital dust?       Table of contents [Show]     2025 AR Price Prediction   2026 AR Price Prediction   2030 AR Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Arweave (AR)   Factors That Could Slow Arweave&#8217;s Growth   Price Prediction Methodology   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 AR Price Prediction  Arweave could post solid gains in 2025. The upside here isn’t driven by hype but by a slow-burning realization: the world needs somewhere to store its decentralized assets and temporary solutions won’t cut it. If Web3 adoption surges and on-chain permanence becomes a priority for developers and DAOs, Arweave could become a trusted backbone. The higher-end estimate of $10.24 assumes real traction, such as more adoption by NFT platforms, decentralized social networks like Lens or Farcaster or integrations with L2s looking to store data off chain but with permanence. Of course, to hit those numbers, Arweave will need to prove it can scale storage demand while keeping costs stable and ensuring availability. It’s one thing to sell permanence; it’s another to deliver it when data scales exponentially. 2026 AR Price Prediction  Analysis suggests the coin could surge in 2026. If the initial hype around permanent storage cools, what remains is whether real-world usage sustains the protocol. Arweave’s performance in 2026 may depend on developer onboarding and partnership integration. If new dApps begin defaulting to Arweave for data immutability (think DeFi logs, legal records or even supply chain receipts) the demand for AR could remain resilient. Otherwise, the protocol risks becoming a niche storage layer for a select few crypto-native applications. 2030 AR Price Prediction  By 2030, Arweave’s outlook is wide open. If you believe the decentralized web will need permanent, censorship-resistant data layers, Arweave could be indispensable. That high-end target assumes the protocol becomes a key pillar in crypto’s storage stack, similar to how Ethereum became synonymous with smart contracts. Permanent archiving for AI models, decentralized search engines or government transparency initiatives could all drive demand to AR. But let’s not ignore the risks. If the Web3 world opts for cheaper, more scalable alternatives like Filecoin or keeps offloading data to centralized silos, AR could struggle to justify its premium storage model. The low-end forecast of $14.40 reflects that potential downside.  Reasons to Invest in Arweave (AR) Arweave isn’t chasing fleeting narratives. It’s offering a fundamental Web3 service. Permanent, immutable data storage that few others even attempt. This long-term approach aligns with the core principles of decentralization: permanence, openness and resistance to censorship. Unlike cloud storage providers that operate on subscription models, Arweave uses a one-time fee to store data forever. This is powered by an economic model built on upfront payments and predictable token issuance. If the cost curve holds and real-world adoption increases, AR could offer both utility and scarcity. Arweave has also carved out a unique moat. Protocols like Mirror, decent.land and even Solana’s historical data storage have leveraged Arweave. That kind of usage isn’t speculative. It’s functional and growing. Factors That Could Slow Arweave’s Growth Let’s not sugarcoat it: permanent storage isn’t exactly a compelling pitch in the current hype cycle. While it’s necessary, it doesn’t spark the same kind of attention as flashy DeFi yields or AI tokens. That could hurt visibility and investment inflow. There’s also the issue of cost. Arweave’s upfront fee model makes sense for permanence but if cheaper decentralized alternatives emerge, it could be hard to justify paying now for forever, especially when “forever” might not be in the budget. Then there’s competition. Filecoin, Crust Network and even centralized giants with Web3 extensions could start nibbling at Arweave’s market share. If they offer hybrid models or better performance, Arweave might find itself priced out. Add in macroeconomic pressures and regulatory uncertainty and AR’s trajectory is anything but guaranteed. It’s not enough to be useful. You have to be compelling and that’s a higher bar to clear when the sector matures. Price Prediction Methodology Our Arweave price forecast through 2030 pulls from a combination of expert analysis, technical indicators and ecosystem growth projections. Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We used pricing insights from crypto research platforms including WalletInvestor, CoinCodex and DigitalCoinPrice. These informed our yearly low, average and high estimates. Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis Arweave’s core value lies in decentralized data permanence. As dApps, L2s and AI tools require immutable storage, AR’s demand could grow if it stays cost effective and developer friendly Macroeconomic Factors AR’s long-term success is tied to broader adoption of decentralized infrastructure. If capital continues flowing into foundational Web3 protocols, Arweave could see strong tailwinds. But if regulation or a shift in tech narratives sidelines permanent storage, AR might lag behind faster-moving narratives like AI, gaming or real-world assets.

The project’s goal is to distribute the power of AI development, potentially leading to greater accessibility and innovation in the field. The decentralized approach could have substantial future value in a world that increasingly relies on AI.&nbsp; Bittensor’s tokenomics centered around the TAO token creates an incentive structure that rewards network participation. The system encourages growth and engagement by compensating those who contribute valuable machine learning models and data. The model has the potential to drive long-term network expansion.&nbsp; The growth potential of the AI sector adds to Bittensor’s appeal. As AI permeates various industries, a platform that merges it with blockchain technology could see significant adoption. The increase of investment into the Bittensor ecosystem from groups like Digital Currency Group and the creation of investment projects from companies like Grayscale show a growing confidence in the project’s future.&nbsp; Factors that Could Slow Bittensor’s Growth One major concern is Bittensor’s technological complexity. The intricate nature of decentralized AI networks can create a steep learning curve for users and developers. The barrier to entry could limit widespread adoption, restricting Bittensor’s growth to a small, technically proficient audience. Simplifying the user experience and providing accessible educational resources will overcome this challenge.&nbsp; While decentralization is a core principle, the risk of creeping centralization poses a threat. If a small group of entities gains disproportionate control over the network, it could undermine the project’s foundational ideals and discourage participation.&nbsp; Aggregate Analyst Forecasts To estimate TAO’s future price, we aggregated predictions from several sources:  Wallet Investor CoinCodex Changelly CoinPedia  These forecasts factor in historical price movements, technical analysis and broader market sentiment. Given TAO’s speculative nature, predictions vary widely, ranging from bearish estimates suggesting declines in a risk-averse market to optimistic projections anticipating new highs in a bullish cycle. Market Trends and Adoption Analysis Increasing interest in open and democratized AI development has propelled Bittensor’s concept of a decentralized machine learning marketplace into the spotlight, attracting attention from both investors and developers. Technological advancements such as the introduction of Dynamic TAO (dTAO) and subnet tokens are designed to enhance network efficiency and utility, driving further adoption.&nbsp; Like most cryptocurrencies, TAO experiences market volatility with price predictions varying based on factors like regulatory changes, competition and overall cryptocurrency market trends. Strategic partnerships with tech companies and academic institutions and increased developer and user activity are crucial for the network’s growth. TAO’s success depends on its ability to deliver scalable, cost-effective AI solutions and establish real-world use cases. Regulatory and Legal Considerations Regulatory and legal considerations surrounding Bittensor are complex because of its unique intersection of blockchain technology and AI. A primary concern is the classification of the TAO token as a security, which would subject Bittensor to securities regulations.&nbsp; Adding to the complexity is the nascent field of AI regulation as governments worldwide establish frameworks for data privacy, algorithm transparency and responsible AI use – all of which could impact Bittensor’s decentralized AI marketplace. Data privacy regulations also are crucial because of the platform’s data exchange for AI model training.&nbsp; Bittensor’s decentralized nature, particularly its decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure, poses regulatory challenges because traditional legal frameworks struggle to adapt to decentralized governance models. Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic forces heavily influence Bittensor’s market behavior. Central bank policies, especially interest rate adjustments, significantly impact investor risk appetite with rising rates often diverting capital from assets like TAO.&nbsp; Inflationary pressures also contribute to market uncertainty, potentially driving some investors toward crypto as a hedge while creating overall volatility.

The system encourages growth and engagement by compensating those who contribute valuable machine learning models and data. The model has the potential to drive long-term network expansion.&nbsp; The growth potential of the AI sector adds to Bittensor’s appeal. As AI permeates various industries, a platform that merges it with blockchain technology could see significant adoption. The increase of investment into the Bittensor ecosystem from groups like Digital Currency Group and the creation of investment projects from companies like Grayscale show a growing confidence in the project’s future.&nbsp; Factors that Could Slow Bittensor’s Growth One major concern is Bittensor’s technological complexity. The intricate nature of decentralized AI networks can create a steep learning curve for users and developers. The barrier to entry could limit widespread adoption, restricting Bittensor’s growth to a small, technically proficient audience. Simplifying the user experience and providing accessible educational resources will overcome this challenge.&nbsp; While decentralization is a core principle, the risk of creeping centralization poses a threat. If a small group of entities gains disproportionate control over the network, it could undermine the project’s foundational ideals and discourage participation.&nbsp; Aggregate Analyst Forecasts To estimate TAO’s future price, we aggregated predictions from several sources:  Wallet Investor CoinCodex Changelly CoinPedia  These forecasts factor in historical price movements, technical analysis and broader market sentiment. Given TAO’s speculative nature, predictions vary widely, ranging from bearish estimates suggesting declines in a risk-averse market to optimistic projections anticipating new highs in a bullish cycle. Market Trends and Adoption Analysis Increasing interest in open and democratized AI development has propelled Bittensor’s concept of a decentralized machine learning marketplace into the spotlight, attracting attention from both investors and developers. Technological advancements such as the introduction of Dynamic TAO (dTAO) and subnet tokens are designed to enhance network efficiency and utility, driving further adoption.&nbsp; Like most cryptocurrencies, TAO experiences market volatility with price predictions varying based on factors like regulatory changes, competition and overall cryptocurrency market trends. Strategic partnerships with tech companies and academic institutions and increased developer and user activity are crucial for the network’s growth. TAO’s success depends on its ability to deliver scalable, cost-effective AI solutions and establish real-world use cases. Regulatory and Legal Considerations Regulatory and legal considerations surrounding Bittensor are complex because of its unique intersection of blockchain technology and AI.

It’s often categorized as a Layer 0 network because of its focus on allowing seamless cross-chain transactions. Its native token, DOT, plays a key role in network security and governance, empowering token holders to participate in decision-making. Polkadot’s founder, Gavin Wood, was also a cofounder of Ethereum, and his reputation as a skilled programmer has contributed to widespread interest and speculation surrounding DOT, driving its prominence in the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;       Table of contents [Show]     2025 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction   2026 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction   2030 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Polkadot   Factors that Could Slow Polkadot&#8217;s Growth   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends and Adoption Analysis   Regulatory and Legal Considerations   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction  2026 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction  2030 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction  Reasons to Invest in Polkadot Polkadot bridges the gaps between isolated blockchains addressing a limitation of the blockchain ecosystem where the lack of seamless communication between chains inhibits widespread adoption and innovation. The potential for cross-chain applications where data and assets flow freely between blockchains is a significant driver of investor interest.&nbsp; Polkadot’s architecture enhances scalability, a key factor for any blockchain platform aiming for mass adoption. Polkadot’s “parachains” which operate in parallel, allow for increased transaction throughput and faster processing speeds than many other traditional blockchains. The scalability positions Polkadot to handle a growing volume of transactions, potentially attracting developers and users looking for efficient, high-performance blockchain solutions.&nbsp; Polkadot’s on-chain governance system allows DOT token holders to participate in the network’s development and decision-making processes. The decentralized governance model promotes community-driven innovation and ensures the platform evolves in a way that reflects the interest of its users. The large number of projects built on Polkadot indicates a strong and active community and increases the long-term potential value of the network.&nbsp; Factors that Could Slow Polkadot’s Growth The blockchain space is fiercely competitive with established platforms like Ethereum and emerging alternatives offering similar interoperability solutions that could limit Polkadot’s market share. Polkadot’s parachain architect, while powerful, presents a barrier to entry for developers and users, which could deter adoption.&nbsp; Ongoing uncertainty over cryptocurrency regulations adds another layer of risk that could dampen investor and developer enthusiasm. Polkadot’s success relies on developing and adopting its parachain ecosystem and delays or lack of compelling use cases could slow growth.&nbsp; Aggregate Analyst Forecasts To estimate DOT’s future price, we aggregated predictions from several sources:  Wallet Investor CoinCodex Changelly CoinPedia  These forecasts factor in historical price movements, technical analysis and broader market sentiment. Given DOT’s speculative nature, predictions vary widely, ranging from bearish estimates suggesting declines in a risk-averse market to optimistic projections anticipating new highs in a bullish cycle. Market Trends and Adoption Analysis Polkadot’s strength is its ability to connect different blockchains (parachains), enabling them to communicate and share data. This addresses a need in the fragmented blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp; Like most cryptocurrencies, DOT’s price is volatile and influenced by broader market trends, regulatory developments and investor sentiment.&nbsp; Continued development and improvements to the Polkadot network are essential for attracting developers and users. Collaborations with other blockchain projects and traditional industries may drive wider adoptions.&nbsp; A strong and active community fosters innovation and promotes Polkadot’s growth.&nbsp; Regulatory and Legal Considerations The cryptocurrency industry as a whole faces increasing regulatory scrutiny. Issues like classifying crypto assets as securities and the taxation of staking rewards are subjects of ongoing legal debate.&nbsp; For example, the ongoing legal battle between the IRS and Joshua and Jessica Jarrett regarding the taxation of staking rewards has implications for proof-of-stake networks like Polkadot. Although not a direct lawsuit against Polkadot, legal situations involving crypto staking do.&nbsp; Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic forces heavily influence Polkadot’s market behavior. Central bank policies, especially interest rate adjustments, significantly impact investor risk appetite, with rising rates often diverting capital from assets like DOT.&nbsp; Inflationary pressures also contribute to market uncertainty, potentially driving some investors toward crypto as a hedge while creating overall volatility.    Frequently Asked Questions     Q   Will Polkadot reach $100?    1 Will Polkadot reach $100?  asked 2025-11-01  James Wells    A   1 Based on current projections, DOT reaching $100 appears highly unlikely within the current forecast window. The highest price prediction by 2030 is just $1.61, reflecting a bearish long-term outlook. While Polkadot has strong fundamentals and a compelling use case for cross-chain interoperability, it would require an extraordinary surge in adoption and market sentiment to push DOT anywhere near the $100 mark.

Feeling confident about this DOT price prediction? You can trade Polkadot on Coinbase—and if you&#8217;re new to the platform, you could earn up to $400 in rewards by completing a few quick educational lessons and making your first qualifying trade. Polkadot (DOT) is a blockchain platform designed to enable interoperability between different blockchains. It’s often categorized as a Layer 0 network because of its focus on allowing seamless cross-chain transactions. Its native token, DOT, plays a key role in network security and governance, empowering token holders to participate in decision-making. Polkadot’s founder, Gavin Wood, was also a cofounder of Ethereum, and his reputation as a skilled programmer has contributed to widespread interest and speculation surrounding DOT, driving its prominence in the cryptocurrency market.&nbsp;       Table of contents [Show]     2025 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction   2026 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction   2030 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Polkadot   Factors that Could Slow Polkadot&#8217;s Growth   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends and Adoption Analysis   Regulatory and Legal Considerations   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions     2025 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction  2026 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction  2030 Polkadot (DOT) Price Prediction  Reasons to Invest in Polkadot Polkadot bridges the gaps between isolated blockchains addressing a limitation of the blockchain ecosystem where the lack of seamless communication between chains inhibits widespread adoption and innovation. The potential for cross-chain applications where data and assets flow freely between blockchains is a significant driver of investor interest.&nbsp; Polkadot’s architecture enhances scalability, a key factor for any blockchain platform aiming for mass adoption. Polkadot’s “parachains” which operate in parallel, allow for increased transaction throughput and faster processing speeds than many other traditional blockchains. The scalability positions Polkadot to handle a growing volume of transactions, potentially attracting developers and users looking for efficient, high-performance blockchain solutions.&nbsp; Polkadot’s on-chain governance system allows DOT token holders to participate in the network’s development and decision-making processes. The decentralized governance model promotes community-driven innovation and ensures the platform evolves in a way that reflects the interest of its users. The large number of projects built on Polkadot indicates a strong and active community and increases the long-term potential value of the network.&nbsp; Factors that Could Slow Polkadot’s Growth The blockchain space is fiercely competitive with established platforms like Ethereum and emerging alternatives offering similar interoperability solutions that could limit Polkadot’s market share. Polkadot’s parachain architect, while powerful, presents a barrier to entry for developers and users, which could deter adoption.&nbsp; Ongoing uncertainty over cryptocurrency regulations adds another layer of risk that could dampen investor and developer enthusiasm. Polkadot’s success relies on developing and adopting its parachain ecosystem and delays or lack of compelling use cases could slow growth.&nbsp; Aggregate Analyst Forecasts To estimate DOT’s future price, we aggregated predictions from several sources:  Wallet Investor CoinCodex Changelly CoinPedia  These forecasts factor in historical price movements, technical analysis and broader market sentiment. Given DOT’s speculative nature, predictions vary widely, ranging from bearish estimates suggesting declines in a risk-averse market to optimistic projections anticipating new highs in a bullish cycle. Market Trends and Adoption Analysis Polkadot’s strength is its ability to connect different blockchains (parachains), enabling them to communicate and share data. This addresses a need in the fragmented blockchain ecosystem.&nbsp; Like most cryptocurrencies, DOT’s price is volatile and influenced by broader market trends, regulatory developments and investor sentiment.&nbsp; Continued development and improvements to the Polkadot network are essential for attracting developers and users. Collaborations with other blockchain projects and traditional industries may drive wider adoptions.&nbsp; A strong and active community fosters innovation and promotes Polkadot’s growth.&nbsp; Regulatory and Legal Considerations The cryptocurrency industry as a whole faces increasing regulatory scrutiny. Issues like classifying crypto assets as securities and the taxation of staking rewards are subjects of ongoing legal debate.&nbsp; For example, the ongoing legal battle between the IRS and Joshua and Jessica Jarrett regarding the taxation of staking rewards has implications for proof-of-stake networks like Polkadot. Although not a direct lawsuit against Polkadot, legal situations involving crypto staking do.&nbsp; Macroeconomic Factors Macroeconomic forces heavily influence Polkadot’s market behavior. Central bank policies, especially interest rate adjustments, significantly impact investor risk appetite, with rising rates often diverting capital from assets like DOT.&nbsp; Inflationary pressures also contribute to market uncertainty, potentially driving some investors toward crypto as a hedge while creating overall volatility.    Frequently Asked Questions     Q   Will Polkadot reach $100?    1 Will Polkadot reach $100?  asked 2025-11-01  James Wells    A   1 Based on current projections, DOT reaching $100 appears highly unlikely within the current forecast window. The highest price prediction by 2030 is just $1.61, reflecting a bearish long-term outlook. While Polkadot has strong fundamentals and a compelling use case for cross-chain interoperability, it would require an extraordinary surge in adoption and market sentiment to push DOT anywhere near the $100 mark.

Feeling confident about this ADA price prediction? You can trade Cardano on Coinbase—and if you&#8217;re new to the platform, you could earn up to $400 in rewards by completing a few quick educational lessons and making your first qualifying trade. Cardano (ADA), one of the most academically grounded and research-driven blockchain platforms, continues to hold a unique position in the crypto ecosystem. Launched in 2017 by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Cardano was built with a peer-reviewed philosophy, aiming to offer scalability, sustainability and interoperability. Unlike many other Layer-1 chains, Cardano uses a methodical and phased development approach, including formal verification to ensure the integrity of its codebase. Cardano has evolved beyond a simple cryptocurrency project. Its proof-of-stake model (Ouroboros), smart contract capabilities and focus on decentralized identity make it a key contender in the future of Web3. As its ecosystem matures with growing DeFi, NFT and real-world application deployments, investors are closely watching ADA’s long-term price potential.        Table of contents [Show]     2025 ADA Price Prediction   2026 ADA Price Prediction   2030 ADA Price Prediction   Reasons to Invest in Cardano (ADA)   Factors That Could Slow Cardano&#8217;s Growth   Price Prediction Methodology   Aggregate Analyst Forecasts   Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis   Macroeconomic Factors   Frequently Asked Questions    2025 ADA Price Prediction  Bullish estimates reflect growing optimism surrounding Cardano’s expanding DeFi ecosystem and successful onboarding of projects via the Plutus smart contract platform. Institutional and retail investor sentiment could rise as Cardano strengthens its identity as a sustainable and secure blockchain. Partnerships in Africa and initiatives around decentralized identity (DID) solutions could drive adoption in underbanked regions. For these catalysts to lift ADA closer to its maximum projection, network throughput and interoperability must continue to improve. 2026 ADA Price Prediction  In 2026, ADA’s price may moderate. This move could follow a period of overextension or reflect macroeconomic headwinds. As crypto markets mature, investor focus may shift toward platforms with the highest real-world use cases and active developer communities. Cardano’s roadmap includes upgrades to boost scalability, such as Hydra and Mithril. If successfully rolled out, these could offer much-needed transaction speed and efficiency improvements. Meanwhile, greater integration with regulatory-compliant frameworks might help ADA gain credibility in institutional circles. Still, regulatory uncertainty and slower dApp traction compared to competitors like Ethereum or Solana may weigh on momentum. 2030 ADA Price Prediction  This mixed outlook reflects both optimism for Cardano’s long-term vision and concerns over its pace of execution. While Cardano’s reputation for stability and security may appeal to governments and enterprises, its delayed delivery timelines could limit growth compared to more agile competitors. If Cardano achieves its full potential, becoming a scalable, regulatory-friendly blockchain for identity, payments and enterprise use, demand for ADA could rise dramatically. Global economic digitization, particularly in emerging markets, might drive use cases that validate Cardano’s original mission. Reasons to Invest in Cardano (ADA) Cardano distinguishes itself through its scientific approach, formal peer reviews and strong emphasis on security and sustainability. Its energy-efficient proof-of-stake consensus model makes it an environmentally conscious alternative to older proof-of-work chains. With a maximum supply cap of 45 billion ADA, Cardano offers scarcity that can support long-term value. The platform&#8217;s commitment to real-world applications, such as identity systems in Ethiopia, supply chain tracking and academic credentialing, positions it uniquely in the market. As Cardano’s DeFi ecosystem grows and interoperability features roll out, ADA’s value proposition as a utility token could strengthen significantly. Factors That Could Slow Cardano’s Growth Despite its vision, Cardano faces challenges. One of the most cited concerns is slow development. While its phased release strategy prioritizes security, it has often lagged behind competitors in launching critical features. This delay has contributed to fewer active dApps and developer migration to faster-moving ecosystems like Ethereum and Solana. Moreover, lack of widespread DeFi adoption and limited NFT traction could dampen ADA demand. If Cardano fails to foster a vibrant developer ecosystem or attract significant user activity, its long-term price growth may be limited. Regulatory pressure or tighter global monetary conditions could also constrain investor appetite for altcoins like ADA. Price Prediction Methodology We used Benzinga’s structured crypto forecast framework to project ADA’s future prices. This includes: Aggregate Analyst Forecasts We compiled data from trusted crypto analysts and platforms like Wallet Investor, CoinCodex, Changelly and CoinPedia to form a range of low, average and high price predictions. Outlier forecasts were assessed for credibility and adjusted to maintain data accuracy. Market Trends &amp; Adoption Analysis Cardano’s use cases in identity, education and governance are gaining attention, especially in developing economies. As the network matures and dApp deployment increases, it could attract both institutional and retail users looking for alternatives to Ethereum. These price levels are critical to monitor for breakout confirmations or reversals through 2025–2026. Macroeconomic Factors Like other digital assets, ADA is influenced by global economic conditions. Interest rate policy, regulatory changes and liquidity flows all play a role in investor sentiment. As central banks shift toward easing or exploring CBDCs, decentralized platforms like Cardano may gain renewed attention for offering alternatives to centralized systems.

A young man sits on a red couch in the lobby of Jakarta’s Marriott hotel, having just walked from his cheap digs round the corner. He’s hot and jaded after a night drinking Bir Bintang. Beige chinos and a blue cotton shirt that sticks to his back are the livery of an eager western journalist in the tropics. A waitress pushes a trolley past wearing a white uniform, starched, like a nurse’s. He orders a glass of water and a coffee. Milk, no sugar. Muzak burbles from somewhere unknown. Simply Red or Michael Bublé? He doesn’t care; he’s more into techno. His mind is already drifting back to the impressionist blur of the bar at Tanamur and the taxi ride home. He’s here to interview a renowned Professor of economics from Princeton University, who’s flown in a day late after getting the time zone wrong. The young man rereads the half dozen questions he’s scribbled in blue ink on an A4 sheet. The list seems banal and makes him sound stupid. His interviewee might sneer. Will an American academic have any idea how fast the region’s economies will grow this year, the first of the new millennium? Surely he’ll pierce through the young reporter’s feigned insight. Most of the questions are cribbed from the web. Are the World Bank and International Monetary Fund bad? Will East Asia’s lingering debts slow progress? The young man had arrived in the region a couple of years earlier, when burning Sumatra blew smoke across the Straits of Malacca. A brown veil covered the window of his forty-second-floor office. Outside, his lungs hurt. Locals wore masks decades before they caught on in the rest of the world.&nbsp; The haze, as locals called it, was caused by Indonesian farmers slashing and torching forests to plant new crops. It enveloped whole countries, seeming to mark the end of the economic boom, a time when countries leapt from the shadows. Sometimes the haze clouded the young man’s mind. He fidgets. He’s read the Prof’s best-seller (only later realising it was a play on the title of an 80s novel and film) and tried in vain to understand some of his academic papers. A decade earlier the Prof had won a big medal for up-and-coming economists – often a pointer to the Nobel. Like most liberals of the time, the young man hoovers up the Prof’s blogs and journalism. As the young man shifts again in his chair an average-sized bearded man with curly dark brown hair ambles across the hotel lobby. He wears an open-necked checked shirt and a blazer. He smiles modestly. The timid inquisitor shakes the hand of his jetlagged respondent. Pleased to meet you-hope you had a good trip-apologies for lateness-never mind (the young man was secretly glad he could spend another evening in the bar). “Do you think Malaysia’s capital controls were a good idea,” he blurts. The Prof makes a sound like a surfacing whale. “Oh, not that old line again.” “If you ask me, it was too late.” The Prof patiently explains what capital controls are: a ban on foreigners trading Malaysia’s currency and limits or levies on how much they can bring in and out of the country. He says tax might sound like a good way for Malaysia to stop investors from fleeing, but the worst has already passed and the rest of the region’s economies are beginning to grow again. The IMF and the World Bank hate the capital controls, he continues, because they violate the free-market rulebook. For that reason, lefties love them. “Will capital controls scare away foreigners in the future?” “Probably not, because everyone’s so desperate to make money.” “How do you see Asia’s – and the world’s – economic prospects now that the crisis has passed?” The Prof again exhales. He says that one of the main things about the world economy in the last few decades is that the United States buys much more from abroad than it sells &#8211; $400 billion more in 1999, to be precise. Other nations make the trinkets that rapacious US consumers crave. American manufacturing has long been dying, so more goods flow into the States than out. “More and more of our imports come from overseas,” President George Bush said that year with a straight face. You’d expect this deficit in trade to kill demand for the US dollar, continues the Prof, but the currency stays strong because the world – and particularly newly rich Asian business owners – invest their profits in American housing and shares. “In accounting terms… Oof, if ever there was a phrase designed to test the attention of a sleepy interviewer. The young man’s bum suddenly hurts and he shuffles in his seat. “… by definition if a country spends more than it earns from trade, it has to borrow or attract investment from abroad to make up the difference. The numbers are roughly equal but opposite—one’s a deficit, the other’s a surplus. The US capital account surplus, or excess of savings, is the inverse of the current account deficit.” How this plays out in practice, continues the Prof, is that the dollar and the explosion in American financial markets feed on Asia’s rise. Huge, booming nations like China and Indonesia offer oceans of cheap labour and resources. Asia’s upturn, based on cheap wages, act as the flipside of the US trade deficit and strong dollar. Plus, Washington mints the world’s currency so everyone has to use it. “Who knows how long this’ll all last? As long as it does, the world’s probably going to be OK,” says the Prof. “But the dollar’s strength despite the trade deficit is like when the cartoon character Wiley Coyote runs off a cliff into thin air. Sooner or later he looks down and plummets to the ground.”   Later, digesting the Prof’s lesson, the young man takes a taxi to Kota port in the north of the city.

The young man wishes he had a better camera to capture the people; and to photo the ships, which look they’re from a Conrad novel.

Many locals blame the economic malaise on the ethnic Chinese, who own a lot of businesses but mostly don’t do the hard graft. Tales circulated of businessmen selling their Mercedes for a few grand at Soekarno-Hatta airport as they fled ethnic unrest. But it wasn’t about race. The crisis was the result of hubris and the insatiable appetite of global investors for high returns. It was a regional bubble stoked by hot money flowing in from abroad and suddenly out again, fuelled by America’s thirst for stuff and blossoming Asia’s happiness to oblige – cheaply. Those stevedores are like hundreds of millions of low-waged workers across the region who power the boom. Their bosses plough the profits into the booming US stock and property markets, propping up the dollar, whose strength boosts American buying power. The United States and Asia are the pincers of a huge crab encircling the globe.   The young man walks on toward Jakarta’s LapanganMerdeka, or independence square. Towering within is the Monas monument, known locally as Sukarno’s last erection, after the first president who was kicked out in 1967. More and more green-uniformed policemen in riot gear carrying four-foot yellow batons. A training exercise, he wonders, in readiness for more demonstrations against the regime? As he draws closer to Jalan Thamrin he comes across students chanting “save Aceh” in English. The students, numbering around 200 and from Jakarta’s Muhammadiyah University, wear headbands bearing the slogan “Aksi Peduli Aceh,” or Aceh Solidarity Action. A police battalion skulks awkwardly at a distance, flowers adorning guns. Gudung Garam cigarettes lace the air with cloves. A powerful woman wearing a green tudong bellows slogans down a megaphone in front of the sitting demonstrators. She punches the air with her fist, inviting the others to follow. The young man thinks his protests against student grant cuts in London were trivial. Someone gives him an orchid, and a badge with a black ribbon which he ties to his rucksack. He chats with one of the organisers, Irwan, who tells him that the demonstrators are protesting against army oppression in Aceh, the northernmost Sumatran province long ruled by Java but with a long and fierce history of independence. Irwan says he disagrees with a new proposal that the army should automatically have seats in parliament. “The army chief should step down,” he says. The police say the protest must end at 4 o’clock. Irwan says they will leave to avoid a confrontation. He doesn’t blame the cops. What’s important is “the system”. He says that what matters is improving democracy and helping workers. Students like him are the product of Asia’s prosperity. Their education and new freedoms prompt them to question the old regime. It’s only a couple of years since the overthrow of dictator Suharto, and a nation is being rebuilt. Irwan and his friends will again grace independence square.  Monumen Nasional, Jakarta, Indonesia, Ramayoni February 10, 2019, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 A year later the young man retired his blue cotton shirt and beige chinos, returning to university to study more economics. He’d been too shy to hunt down big scoops, and his editors didn’t want him to peer through the haze. They were only interested in what was good for American business. In Singapore, he wasn’t allowed to touch politics in case the censorious regime kicked his magazine out of the country. The story was all about the city-state’s prowess in science, a sparkling new trade deal and how the buses ran on time: Singapore-lah. An article he wrote about Aceh had to be about how activists used the Internet rather than why people wanted to break with Jakarta after decades of violent oppression. And anyway in the end it was the sea, not politics, that killed the dream of independence. The Indian ocean Tsunami in 2004 swallowed up some of the Acehnese campaigners he interviewed in the province, along with nearly a quarter of a million other people. The Prof won his Nobel prize. A quarter of a century later he quit his newspaper column so that he could rail more freely against US president Donald Trump on his blogs. He’d become a kind of thought-haven for right-minded American liberals. He described the US president variously as a virus infecting American capitalism; a cancer that grew in the dark; and like Mao’s cultural revolution – an attack on democracy and intellectual inquiry. Wiley Coyote seemed to hang in the air, as the chasm beneath him, the US trade deficit, more than doubled to a trillion dollars. The world kept ploughing money into American shares and property, driving an explosion in wealth and inequality as the pay of US blue-collar workers stagnated while investments in housing and shares rocketed. By 2025 the richest top tenth owned nearly three-quarters of household wealth and about nine-tenths of the stock market.&nbsp; The profits from work outsourced to Asia were recycled so hard into American assets like houses, that the annual salaries of Gen-Z now bought less than a fifth of a house, compared with half for a Boomer in the 1950s. The average Gen Z blue-collar worker in the Midwest was now worse off than their grandparents. Pay lay in the gutter. Such generational decline was a first in the country’s young history. Any doubts about Asia’s economies recovering from the crisis were immediately dispelled as they started racing again, led by China. There, factories tripled their output in the next decade, outpacing all other major economies.&nbsp;When the young man lived in Asia, China made about 6% of the world’s stuff. By 2025, a third of everything was made there. Add in Asia and the share grew to more than a half. The idea that the region might sputter and fade was, in retrospect, ridiculous. Those Jakarta stevedores may not have been on the factory floor, but they were part of the often invisible, hard-working and low-paid regional working class that fuelled these emerging nations and supplied the world’s goods. The wood that built things; the people who carried the wood; the ships that transported them; the coal, oil, copper, and nickel; the factory workers on subsistence wages—they built the new millennium. They had more in common with their rustbelt brethren than they knew. The global financiers who profited from this feature, and the politicians they funded, would wheedle resources and cheap labour from wherever they could for as long as possible. Americans seemed hard-wired to consume. The US would never return to some golden age of middle-class prosperity where the international trading ledger balanced. Yet Trump campaigned on the impossible promise to eliminate the trade deficit. In all his idiocy, and without being able to articulate it, he was preying on the anger at the global system; the inequality that arose from wage stagnation and the boom in asset and house prices. In his dim, animalistic way, the president knew that this global lop-sidedness was the cause of his voters’ problems. His solution – balancing the trade account via tariffs – was blunt and stupid, and he kept changing his mind. But he and his advisors were in effect responding to the Prof’s lesson from back in the year 2000, that a country has to borrow or attract investment from abroad to make up the difference. To cut the trade deficit, Trump and co now wanted to stem the tide of investment flowing inwards. Paradoxically it was the United States, not wayward Malaysia, that now proposed controls on capital. Trump in 2025 proposed tightening investment rules, making it harder for supposed adversaries like China to invest in sensitive American sectors like tech and land. He proposed taxing foreign investors whose governments purportedly acted unfairly against the US.&nbsp;Some of Trump’s advisers even floated the idea of charging foreigners to buy US bonds. So it was paradoxically the US that ended up scrapping the free-market rulebook, not Asia. The young man came to realise later that the Prof., a savant who mixed metaphors and so hated Trump, missed the point. The cheap Asian labour and resources that fed the global boom, and the American appetite for more goods than it made, weren’t aberrations that debased the economy; they were a feature. It was how the global economy worked. There was no cliff, and no Wiley. Trump wasn’t a virus, a cancer, or Mao. He was a response to a decades-old feature of the global economy that enriched the rich and trampled the have-nots. Wishing for a return to some mythical normality wouldn’t help. Populists – Trump or otherwise – would keeping stoking the discontent and benefitting from it. The young man, not so young or eager now, occasionally thinks back to his time in Asia. He’s still into techno and occasionally goes to bars – though less often. He sometimes reluctantly labours under the label of economist, and spends too much of his time thinking, rethinking, and wondering how far the smoke will spread.

A young man sits on a red couch in the lobby of Jakarta’s Marriott hotel, having just walked from his cheap digs round the corner. He’s hot and jaded after a night drinking Bir Bintang. Beige chinos and a blue cotton shirt that sticks to his back are the livery of an eager western journalist in the tropics. A waitress pushes a trolley past wearing a white uniform, starched, like a nurse’s. He orders a glass of water and a coffee. Milk, no sugar. Muzak burbles from somewhere unknown. Simply Red or Michael Bublé? He doesn’t care; he’s more into techno. His mind is already drifting back to the impressionist blur of the bar at Tanamur and the taxi ride home. He’s here to interview a renowned Professor of economics from Princeton University, who’s flown in a day late after getting the time zone wrong. The young man rereads the half dozen questions he’s scribbled in blue ink on an A4 sheet. The list seems banal and makes him sound stupid. His interviewee might sneer. Will an American academic have any idea how fast the region’s economies will grow this year, the first of the new millennium? Surely he’ll pierce through the young reporter’s feigned insight. Most of the questions are cribbed from the web. Are the World Bank and International Monetary Fund bad? Will East Asia’s lingering debts slow progress? The young man had arrived in the region a couple of years earlier, when burning Sumatra blew smoke across the Straits of Malacca. A brown veil covered the window of his forty-second-floor office. Outside, his lungs hurt. Locals wore masks decades before they caught on in the rest of the world.&nbsp; The haze, as locals called it, was caused by Indonesian farmers slashing and torching forests to plant new crops. It enveloped whole countries, seeming to mark the end of the economic boom, a time when countries leapt from the shadows. Sometimes the haze clouded the young man’s mind. He fidgets. He’s read the Prof’s best-seller (only later realising it was a play on the title of an 80s novel and film) and tried in vain to understand some of his academic papers. A decade earlier the Prof had won a big medal for up-and-coming economists – often a pointer to the Nobel. Like most liberals of the time, the young man hoovers up the Prof’s blogs and journalism. As the young man shifts again in his chair an average-sized bearded man with curly dark brown hair ambles across the hotel lobby. He wears an open-necked checked shirt and a blazer. He smiles modestly. The timid inquisitor shakes the hand of his jetlagged respondent. Pleased to meet you-hope you had a good trip-apologies for lateness-never mind (the young man was secretly glad he could spend another evening in the bar). “Do you think Malaysia’s capital controls were a good idea,” he blurts. The Prof makes a sound like a surfacing whale. “Oh, not that old line again.” “If you ask me, it was too late.” The Prof patiently explains what capital controls are: a ban on foreigners trading Malaysia’s currency and limits or levies on how much they can bring in and out of the country. He says tax might sound like a good way for Malaysia to stop investors from fleeing, but the worst has already passed and the rest of the region’s economies are beginning to grow again. The IMF and the World Bank hate the capital controls, he continues, because they violate the free-market rulebook. For that reason, lefties love them. “Will capital controls scare away foreigners in the future?” “Probably not, because everyone’s so desperate to make money.” “How do you see Asia’s – and the world’s – economic prospects now that the crisis has passed?” The Prof again exhales. He says that one of the main things about the world economy in the last few decades is that the United States buys much more from abroad than it sells &#8211; $400 billion more in 1999, to be precise. Other nations make the trinkets that rapacious US consumers crave. American manufacturing has long been dying, so more goods flow into the States than out. “More and more of our imports come from overseas,” President George Bush said that year with a straight face. You’d expect this deficit in trade to kill demand for the US dollar, continues the Prof, but the currency stays strong because the world – and particularly newly rich Asian business owners – invest their profits in American housing and shares. “In accounting terms… Oof, if ever there was a phrase designed to test the attention of a sleepy interviewer.

Lesotho, where the original tariff would have been 50%, experiences the biggest reprieve, but its exporters will still face headwinds. Of the LDCs, Lesotho is the most exposed to US exports. Nearly three-quarters of its exports go to the US, amounting to 16% of its GDP. The economic damage before the high tariff would’ve been high — at an estimated tenth of GDP. Now, the the impact could amount to a couple of percentage points of GDP. This will still mean job losses or furlough, higher poverty, and further instability for a struggling economy. It’s wrong to imagine that the threat has receded. Haiti and Cambodia, too, remain exposed. Although a relatively small proportion of Haiti’s economy is reliant on US exports (about 5%), its total export basket is heavily US-dependent. Cambodia is more reliant on the US but its exports more geographically diversified (mainly toward Europe). Bangladesh’s total exports are the highest of any LDC (shown by the size of the bubble in the diagram below) but its reliance on the US is lower, at only about 2% of GDP. The following diagram shows that tariffs will continue to affect the LDCs most exposed to the US. Data source: OEC But it’s the policy unpredictability that’s the worst. Effectively the US has thrown the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) into question, ending the situation whereby African goods faced duty-free entry into the US. Renewal already looked unlikely. AGOA’s vulnerability to non-renewal was always its Achilles heel relative to the European Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, which was written into law in 2001 and remained less likely to be rescinded. AGOA’s demise means that some trade will be diverted toward Europe. Everyone knows businesses hate uncertainty — why would you expand your US-export orientated investment in Lesotho now, when Trump might change his mind next week? Few existing or potential investors anywhere, never mind in the LDCs, will see the US as a source of stability. And the effect of the tariffs on the US economy is the biggest source of uncertainty. Never mind a 10% tariff, a US — or global — recession is a much scarier proposition. Lower growth in the world’s economic engine will have the biggest effect on LDCs as all economies lose out. US consumers are already cutting back. Treasury bond yields have spiked (which forced Trump’s about-face). The dollar is in decline, further reducing US buying power. As stagflation beckons, few should look to the US for support. As in previous crises, clumsy and short-termist mismanagement by the world’s biggest economies and the global financial institutions that they control are the worst problems for the LDCs. A quarter century of crisis At least a dozen major environmental and economic crises have whacked the LDCs in the last quarter-century, often at the same time, starting with the dotcom crash in 2000. The Indian ocean Tsunami was in 2005. Then came the devastation of the global financial crisis in 2008. Cyclone Nargis the same year was the worst natural disaster in the history of Myanmar. Many other environmental or weather-related events severely affected smaller countries &#8211; like the Western Pacific’s cyclone Pam in 2015, which chopped off half of Vanuatu’s GDP in a year. The eurozone calamity from 2009-10 hit commodity and tourism demand worldwide — with a major fallout for LDCs. An earthquake struck Haiti. The drought in the Sahel followed, then the big three: Covid-19, inflation and now Trump.  Of course earthquakes and tsunamis aren’t human-made, but most of the others are, and they’re the result of mismanagement — either economic or environmental. Global heating is perhaps the ultimate act of foot-shooting. It’s generated by the rich world and it’s hitting the poorest the most. Small, poorer countries have fewer resources to cope with the impact of crises. Infrastructure is more fragile. Losing a job can mean starvation. No safety nets exist. So Trump’s tariffs aren’t only a self-inflicted wound. They’re a blow inflicted on the world’s most vulnerable. And just as many of the crises of the past quarter century could have been avoided or ameliorated, this latest bout of policy stupidity wasn’t inevitable. I’ve long thought that we don’t need to get too clever in our theories about how to improve the relationship between the rich and poor countries (or core and periphery, developed and developing, or North and South — whichever couplet the theory demands). No, one of the first and most achievable things would be for the rich world to stop doing supposedly self-interested but ill-considered things which have a disproportionate impact on the world’s poorest.

", "title": "Stop doing stupid stuff", "content": "Unpredictability and instability are worse than tariffs US tariffs will still hit several of the least developed countries hard, despite the US reducing them to 10%. Lesotho, where the original tariff would have been 50%, experiences the biggest reprieve, but its exporters will still face headwinds. Of the LDCs, Lesotho is the most exposed to US exports. Nearly three-quarters of its exports go to the US, amounting to 16% of its GDP. The economic damage before the high tariff would’ve been high — at an estimated tenth of GDP. Now, the the impact could amount to a couple of percentage points of GDP. This will still mean job losses or furlough, higher poverty, and further instability for a struggling economy. It’s wrong to imagine that the threat has receded. Haiti and Cambodia, too, remain exposed. Although a relatively small proportion of Haiti’s economy is reliant on US exports (about 5%), its total export basket is heavily US-dependent. Cambodia is more reliant on the US but its exports more geographically diversified (mainly toward Europe). Bangladesh’s total exports are the highest of any LDC (shown by the size of the bubble in the diagram below) but its reliance on the US is lower, at only about 2% of GDP. The following diagram shows that tariffs will continue to affect the LDCs most exposed to the US. Data source: OEC But it’s the policy unpredictability that’s the worst. Effectively the US has thrown the African Growth and Opportunities Act (AGOA) into question, ending the situation whereby African goods faced duty-free entry into the US. Renewal already looked unlikely. AGOA’s vulnerability to non-renewal was always its Achilles heel relative to the European Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, which was written into law in 2001 and remained less likely to be rescinded. AGOA’s demise means that some trade will be diverted toward Europe. Everyone knows businesses hate uncertainty — why would you expand your US-export orientated investment in Lesotho now, when Trump might change his mind next week? Few existing or potential investors anywhere, never mind in the LDCs, will see the US as a source of stability. And the effect of the tariffs on the US economy is the biggest source of uncertainty. Never mind a 10% tariff, a US — or global — recession is a much scarier proposition. Lower growth in the world’s economic engine will have the biggest effect on LDCs as all economies lose out. US consumers are already cutting back. Treasury bond yields have spiked (which forced Trump’s about-face). The dollar is in decline, further reducing US buying power.

The US tariffs unveiled on Wednesday will hit all 44 of the world’s&nbsp;least developed countries&nbsp;(LDCs), in some cases slashing economic growth and lowering employment — with a potentially serious impact on livelihoods. From 9 April, 31 of these countries will face a tariff rate of 10%, while in the remaining 13 rates range from 11% in Democratic Republic of the Congo, to 50% in Lesotho. For some countries, the shock will be severe. The affected African exporters will move from zero duties under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), to high rates. Several of these countries depend heavily on access to the US market. Other LDCs, like Bangladesh and Cambodia, will shift from special LDC concessionary levies at or near zero, to much higher rates — 37% in Bangladesh and 49% for Cambodia. This big new tax on every Cambodian or Bangladeshi T-shirt crossing the US border will dramatically increase costs and put those industries under strain. The move represents a major break from the last two decades, when LDCs were given duty-free, quota free access to many major markets, including the US, as part of a concerted international push to integrate the world’s least-advantaged nations into the global economy. These efforts met with mixed success, but now, just as these these mostly small, poor countries are struggling to recover from the catastrophe of Covid-19 and the supply-chain and inflation crisis, they’re being pushed down even further. Never mind kicking away the ladder; it’s a case of holding their heads under water. My initial calculations on the possible impacts are shown in the following figure.  Data source: OEC   Notes for nerds: The y-axis is the log of the estimated impact on GDP, in percentage terms. The x-axis is the % tariff rate faced by each LDC. The size of each bubble represents the log of total exports to the US, while the colour, from blue to red, signifies the proportion of the country’s exports going to the US. In the basic model used to make the calculations, I assume an elasticity of -0.75 for garments. Studies suggest that a 1% price increase reduces apparel demand by 0.5% to 1% (an elasticity of -0.5 to -1). So assuming a elasticity of of -0.75, half way between these levels, a 50% price increase could reduce demand in Lesotho by 37.5% (0.75 × 50%), a loss of $120 million. Garments are easily substitutable, so this seems plausible. For commodity exporters like Angola and DR Congo I assume a lower elasticity of -0.4. I also assume that the impact of reduced spending on each economy multiplies the impact by 1.5 to 2. Clearly this is a very basic model put together quickly that hasn&#8217;t been academically reviewed, and doubtless has shortcomings. But it serves as a rough guide as to which countries will be affected worst, together with the magnitudes.    Lesotho&nbsp;will suffer worst, given the dependence of the economy on exports to the US, mostly garments. Lesotho’s $2.05 billion economy sends approximately $320 million in garments to the US, or three quarters of all exports, manufactured in zones near the capital Maseru, which are run by Chinese and Taiwanese investors. About 36,000 people work in these factories, which provide much-needed employment in a country where the poverty rate tops half of all people. This is a poor and vulnerable country which desperately needs all the help it can get. For example when I last visited about a dozen years ago, average life expectancy was only 47. Now, it’s risen, but to only 53, one of the lowest levels in the world. The overall impact on Lesotho’s GDP could be as high as 10%. Of course manufacturers might switch some production elsewhere, but supply chains are most likely carefully designed to meet the exact demand of US consumers, and new markets won’t easily be found, especially when other garment exporters are facing the same situation. Instead of cutting jobs, employers might try to furlough workers or pay them less — although neither of these options would be good. It’s quite possible that investors will simply shut up shup and move elsewhere. The industry is surprisingly footloose, with relatively low capital outlays and basic skill levels. Because of the poor design of the tariffs and the fact that they’re somewhat arbitrary, some countries may just shift production to a low tariff neighbour and carry on as usual. Might an African neighbour benefit? Trump doesn’t seem to know about&nbsp;rules of origin. Either way, the impact could be disastrous. Cambodia&nbsp;is also going to get hammered unless something changes. About 35% of its exports, also mostly garments, go to the US. That’s about 8.7% of GDP. My basic calculations suggest that the impact on GDP could be as much as 5% — not as bad as Lesotho but still highly destabilising in a poor country with limited opportunity for diversification and facing fierce competition. Madagascar’s&nbsp;vanilla exporters are also likely to suffer. About a quarter of the country’s exports go to the US and it faces a 47% tariff. Laos, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Angola&nbsp;equally face a potentially severe impact. All either meet the criteria to graduate from the LDC category or are imminently scheduled to do so. The US tariffs will set back their cause. Bangladesh is the world’s second-largest garment exporter and the industry has propelled the country to high rates of economic growth in recent years, leading to poverty reduction of as much as 50 million. Against the backdrop of the country’s recent regime change, the huge garment industry needs to be supported, not undermined. Although Bangladesh didn’t benefit significantly from the US duty-free, quota-free scheme, the 20% of exports that go to the US cannot quickly switch to Europe. During my visits to Dhaka, business leaders told me they could cope with the few percentage points tariff increase that may come through LDC graduation, but presumably not 37%. It will be workers who pay, not factory owners. Over&nbsp;3000 people have died&nbsp;in&nbsp;Myanmar&nbsp;following the earthquake last Friday. However poisonous the regime, slapping the country with a 44% tariff at this time seems positively cruel. European investors told me when I went to Naypyidaw and Yangon before the 2021 coup that the country was already barely competitive in garments, and risked losing business to more stable and cheaper Asian neighbours. The same goes for&nbsp;Haiti.&nbsp;60% of its exports — again garments — go to the US. The country is reported as being essentially ungovernable, with gangs controlling large parts of the capital, Port-au-Prince and the economy in freefall. Although the US tariff is ‘only’ 10%, it’ll still have an impact on an already desperate situation, given the volumes involved, the dire need for jobs and the undiversified nature of the economy. I&nbsp;worked in Haiti&nbsp;during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and only on a few occasions have I been amidst such destruction, and seen such hopelessness. Things have got worse since then. Inflicting more pain on a country where nearly 60% live below the poverty line seems simply abusive. A devastating failure Most LDCs will escape any major impact because they don’t export much to US, total exports were minimal, or the proposed tariff is low — or some combination of the three. Several didn’t benefit much from the US duty-free scheme anyway. Some LDCs might be able to switch export to other markets. Doubtless China will swoop in to buy more from the commodity producers. The EU is already preparing to receive a flood of goods previously destined for the US market but which will now be diverted. But overall, in the eight or more counties where the tariffs will have a major impact, jobs at risk could total as many as 380,000 — mostly in Bangladesh and Cambodia, but also elsewhere. Any job in an LDC is a hard-won prize, and replacing lost employment is often much harder than in richer, more diversified countries. The loss of export revenues could reach as much as a quarter of the total from LDCs unless something changes. For Lesotho and Myanmar the potential economic impact will be severe and possibly even unmanageable. LDCs don’t have unemployment benefits and most people have no or minimal savings. And this is on top of&nbsp;US aid cuts, which are already biting hard. What’s horribly ironic is that the tariffs on these countries won’t even benefit the US, which isn’t quickly going to bring back garment production — nor should it want to. US workers won’t graft for six days a week making T-shirts for $100 a month, as Bangladeshis do. The US can’t even produce some of the things it’s supposedly ‘protecting’. Good luck growing bananas or coffee. The tariffs will mean higher costs for US businesses and consumers. And the collective trade surplus of the LDCs with the US amounts to only 0.001% of the US trade deficit, so will make absolutely no difference to Trump’s stated (stupid) aim of ‘balanced’ trade — not that tariffs will do so anyway. In sum, these half-baked and poorly-thought-out tariffs, which will raise rates to the highest in over a century, will not only fail, but will needlessly inflict yet more pain on populations that were already suffering from severe poverty and deprivation. As i’ve&nbsp;said elsewhere, the oligarchs currently mismanaging the US economy don’t care. They view ordinary people as expendable, and any unintended consequences arising from their blunders as meaningless collateral damage.
